                    <h2>Contributing Members</h2>
                    <p>The bylaws of the Micronaut Foundation provide that Object Computing will maintain, in perpetuity, a majority interest in the Foundation to serve as a steward of the Micronaut framework and its growing global open source community. Object Computing has committed an initial contribution of $2M to fund open source product development and evangelism for the Micronaut framework.
                        “Our focus continues to be directed at building and helping our community create better technology,” said Jeff Scott Brown. “This is what we do and will continue to do. The community is an important part of this journey for us — the most important part of the journey. Our commitment to honor and serve this community continues to grow.”
                    The Foundation relies on the financial support of our Contributing Members.  If you are interested in becoming a Contributing Member, please contact us at <a href="mailto:foundation@micronaut.io">foundation@micronaut.io</a></p>
                    <h2>The Micronaut Foundation Technology Advisory Board</h2>
                    <p>The Micronaut Foundation is supported by a Technology Advisory Board that ensures the Framework continues to reflect and serve its diverse and growing user community. The Board will meet quarterly to discuss and make recommendations regarding the Micronaut framework's roadmap and technical direction.</p>
                    <p>“The formation of the Foundation reflects the growing need to balance the diverse range of interests from the Micronaut framework's community and contributing organizations,” said Graeme Rocher, co-founder of the Micronaut framework. “As the Micronaut framework's adoption continues to accelerate, the additional governance provided by the Foundation will ensure all interested parties have a voice, resulting in a much more inclusive approach to the direction of the project.”</p>
