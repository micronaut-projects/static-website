The [Micronaut team](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team) at [Object Computing, Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/) (OCI) is excited to announce the release of [Micronaut 1.3 RC1](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/releases/tag/v1.3.0.RC1). This is the first release candidate of Micronaut 1.3, and we anticipate a very short RC cycle, so please undertake testing right away in your existing Micronaut 1.2.x applications.

For further information on the release and all the new features, see the [release notes](https://docs.micronaut.io/1.3.0.RC1/guide/index.html#whatsNew).

Thanks to all those who contributed to the release, and we look forward to your feedback as we progress Micronaut 1.3 toward a GA release.
