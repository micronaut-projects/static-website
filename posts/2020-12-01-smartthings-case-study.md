We're always excited to see how organizations use the Micronaut framework to enhance their operations.

For example, when [SmartThings](https://www.smartthings.com/), a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics, had a legacy system that couldn't keep up with the requirements of its popular smart-home devices, the company's engineers turned to the Micronaut framework to build a solution.

By replacing its monolith architecture with a more flexible microservice-based system built with the Micronaut framework, SmartThings is moving forward with a faster, more scalable system and dramatically improving its customers' satisfaction with their smart homes.
