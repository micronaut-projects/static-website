## OVERVIEW

**GalecinoCar is a port of DonkeyCar, a Python-based project using Java and Groovy presented at re:Invent 2017.**

In this complimentary webinar, Ryan Vanderwerf presents an overview of the technology behind GalecinoCar, a 1/16-scale self-driving car built using machine learning, a Raspberry Pi 3, Groovy, Java, and the Grails teamâ€™s new microservice framework, Micronaut.

Ryan explains how he and his team built GalecinoCar and demonstrates:

- How you can control a vehicle using a Raspberry Pi and Micronaut to control motors and servos
- How the team integrated the Karas/Tensorflow alongside the JVM for self-driving functions
- How the CNN AI works 

## OUTLINE

The following topics are covered in this webinar.

- Overview of the GalecinoCar project
- The hardware that supports the technology
- The software that makes it run
- The future of Micronaut, machine learning, and self-driving vehicles

Anyone interested in getting a peek under the hood of a self-driving car will find this webinar interesting.

Software developers who have been following the evolution of Micronaut will get a chance to see a fun, outside-of-the-box use case for the technology, and those who work with JVM microservice frameworks, hardware, and machine learning may be inspired to try their hands at building their own autonomous vehicles!
