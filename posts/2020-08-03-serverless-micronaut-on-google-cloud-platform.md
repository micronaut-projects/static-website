## OVERVIEW

Thanks to its performance, low memory consumption, and lightning-fast startup time, Micronaut is particularly well-suited for services that run on serverless solutions.

"But it takes so much time to build infrastructure," you might be thinking.

We get it. You don't want to let infrastructure slow down your progress.

But ... serverless, though.

So let's explore how to take advantage of readily available serverless solutions!

If you're ready to discover how you can relax, focus on your Micronaut code, and rapidly deploy it as a function, as an application, or within a container on Google Cloud Platform, join Google Developer Advocate, Guillaume Laforge, to get insider tips for using Cloud Functions, App Engine, and Cloud Run.

In this complimentary, 60-minute webinar, Guillaume demonstrates the options you have to deploy your Micronaut applications and services on Google Cloud without spending all your time on infrastructure. He covers an easy way to get started by using a Micronaut Launch template project and explains how, with just a few tweaks, you can push your code to production.
