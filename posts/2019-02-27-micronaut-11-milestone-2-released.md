The [Micronaut Team](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team) at [Object Computing, Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/) (OCI) is pleased to announce the release of [Micronaut 1.1 Milestone 2](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/releases/tag/v1.1.0.M2). 

Micronaut 1.1 includes a number of significant refinements since Micronaut's groundbreaking 1.0 release including:

*   Support for [GRPC](https://grpc.io)
*   [Message-Driven Microservices with RabbitMQ](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-rabbitmq/latest/guide/)
*   A new [BeanIntrospection API](https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/guide/index.html#introspection) for reflection-free Bean introspection.
*   Support for [AWS API Gateway](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#apiProxy) and [GraalVM Custom Runtime ](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#customRuntimes)
*   [AWS Alexa Lambda](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#alexa) support
*   Native File Watch and Fast Server Restart
*   New test templates for [Micronaut Test](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html)
*   Even faster cold start time and performance optimizations
*   ... and [many more features and refinements](https://docs.micronaut.io/1.1.x/guide/index.html#whatsNew)

In the next few weeks leading up to Devnexus 2019, we will be posting additional content covering some of these features in anticipation of the first release candidate of 1.1.

The next milestone of Micronaut 1.1 will be the first RC!

Response to the release of Micronaut 1.0 has been outstanding, and we look forward to hearing feedback from early adopters of Micronaut 1.1\. See you at [Devnexus 2019](https://devnexus.com)!
