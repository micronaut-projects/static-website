It is with great excitement that the [Micronaut team](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team) at [Object Computing, Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/) (OCI) announces the [release of Micronaut 1.0 GA](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0) today.

Over a year in the making, Micronaut 1.0 represents a major leap forward in our mission to enable developers to create efficient, low-memory-footprint microservices and serverless apps for the JVM.

Micronaut includes [all the tools a modern developer needs](https://docs.micronaut.io) to effectively build microservices for the JVM without compromising memory footprint and startup time, including:

*   Integrated compile-time dependency injection and AOP
*   Cloud-native configuration management
*   Service discovery and client-side load balancing
*   Integrated HTTP client and server-based Netty
*   Sensible defaults and auto configuration

For insight into the design and development of Micronaut 1.0, check out InfoQ's ["Road to Micronaut 1.0"](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/10/the-road-to-micronaut-1.0) article and my previous posts on ["The Power of Ahead of Time Compilation."](/blog/2018-10-08-micronaut-10-rc2.html)

To find out more about Micronaut in person, come to [my presentation on Thursday](https://oracle.rainfocus.com/widget/oracle/oow18/catalogcodeone18?search=Micronaut) at [Oracle CodeOne 2018](https://objectcomputing.com/resources/events/conferences/oracle-code-one-2018), or alternatively next week [at Voxxed Days](https://voxxeddays.com/microservices/2018/10/05/graeme-rocher-on-micronaut/) in Paris.
