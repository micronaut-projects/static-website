Both development speed and execution speed are highly critical in today’s market. The Micronaut framework is built around conventions that not only simplify and accelerate development, they make use of compile-time metaprogramming to offer fast startup and runtime performance.

In this 90-minute, complimentary webinar, you’ll learn how to create and test Micronaut applications using Kotlin. Join Agile guru, Dr. Venkat Subramaniam for a lively and informative tutorial that will prepare you to:

- Develop with Micronaut and deploy on the cloud
- Quickly build both the server sides and the client sides
- Program for high availability and make use of circuit breakers
- Make use of Reactive APIs
- Create automated tests for your microservices

Topics covered in this webinar include:

- The power of Micronaut
- Creating microservices
- Compile-time dependency injection
- Deploying to the cloud
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Dealing with failures
- Building Reactive services and clients

Experience with Kotlin is not necessary to gain value from this webinar; the presentation prepares attendees to readily apply lessons to their applications using any of the supported languages.
