As a not-for-profit organization, the [Micronaut® Foundation](https://micronaut.io/foundation/index.html) relies on the financial support of our Contributing Members to support and grow the Micronaut framework. With that, we are excited to announce two new sponsorship programs: the Corporate Sponsorship Program and the Community Member Sponsorship Program.

The generous support of our Corporate Sponsors allows the Micronaut Foundation to continue to ensure technical innovation and advancement of the Micronaut project. Contributing Members may support the Micronaut Foundation by contributing at one of our defined Corporate sponsorship levels or by making an anonymous donation to the Foundation. There are five tiers of sponsorship: Ambassador, Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze. If you are interested in supporting the Micronaut Foundation as an organization, please see our [Corporate Sponsorship page](https://micronaut.io/foundation/sponsorship.html) for more details.

The Micronaut Foundation is also supported by our Community Member Sponsorship Program. We sincerely believe all of us is better than any one of us, and that energizes and guides us in all that we do. As a member of the Micronaut Foundation Community “All Stars,” you are part of our project’s success, so thank you!!  We are delighted to have such a passionate and engaged community and truly appreciate your support.

An individual may become a Community All Star by making a financial contribution to any of our defined sponsorship levels or by making an anonymous donation to the Foundation. There are three levels of sponsorship: VIP, Super Fan, and Champion. If you are interested in supporting the Micronaut Foundation as an individual, please see our [Community Member Sponsorship page](https://micronaut.io/foundation/community-sponsorship.html) for more details.

Please reach out to the Micronaut Foundation Board of Directors at <foundation@micronaut.io> to discuss additional opportunities to support and engage with our team or ask any questions you may have regarding sponsorship details.

Thank you in advance for sharing it back and contributing to the Micronaut Foundation so that we can continue to ensure technical innovation and advancement of the Micronaut framework as a free and open public use software development framework for a growing global community!
