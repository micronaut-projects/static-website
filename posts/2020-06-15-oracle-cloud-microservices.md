## OVERVIEW 

The brochure says you can build "cloud-native" microservices with Micronaut ...

... but what does that actually mean?

While other frameworks may have been retrofitted to accommodate cloud deployment, Micronaut was designed with built-in support for cloud services and hosting.

Yep. That's right. Micronaut doesn't just allow for the development and deployment of cloud-based applications; Micronaut was actually created from the ground up to simplify the process.

Join Oracle Developer Advocate, Todd Sharp, in this 60-minute, complimentary webinar to learn how to:

- Create a simple Micronaut app
- Set up CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- Add distributed configuration via Oracle Cloud Vault
- Configure your application
- Add CRUD support

Todd also discusses schema migration, testing, and how you can deploy a Micronaut app to the Oracle Cloud absolutely free!
