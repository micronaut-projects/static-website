Multi-tenancy, as it relates to software development, is when a single instance of an application is used to service multiple clients (tenants) in such a way that each tenant's data is isolated from the other. Among other things, multi-tenancy enables you to build software as a service (SaaS) applications.
 
In this complimentary webinar, JVM developers interested in learning how to integrate multi-tenancy in their Micronaut applications get an introduction to Micronaut's multi-tenancy capabilities, including microservice-specific features, such as tenant propogation, and an in-depth demonstration of how to implement this powerful functionality.

- Micronaut built-in tenant resolver
