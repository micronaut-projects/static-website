## OVERVIEW

In this 45-minute talk presented at Voxxed Days Microservices Paris in October 2018, Micronaut co-founder, Graeme Rocher, introduces the framework and demonstrates how you can take your microservices to the next level with Micronaut's ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and Oracle's GraalVM to achieve instant startup and low memory footprint.

Micronaut is a brand new, open source, JVM-based framework for building full-stack, modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications.

Unlike reflection-based IoC frameworks which load and cache reflection data for every single field, method, and constructor in your code, with Micronaut, your application startup time and memory consumption are not bound to the size of your codebase.

Micronaut's cloud support is built right in, including support for common discovery services, distributed tracing tools, and cloud runtimes.

In this talk, Graeme introduces the framework and demonstrates how you can take your microservices to the next level with Micronaut's ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and Oracle's GraalVM to achieve instant startup with an astonishingly lean memory footprint.
