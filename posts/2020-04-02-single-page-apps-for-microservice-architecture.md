title: Single Page Apps for a Microservice Architecture
description: Single-page applications (SPAs) don't have to be incompatible with microservice architectures. In this complimentary, on-demand webinar, Zachary Klein demonstrates how to use Micronaut to simplify gateways, security, and multi-tenancy when building SPAs for microservices.

Single-page applications (SPAs) are typically built as dynamic clients that interact with your web application through REST or some other HTTP-friendly protocol, with the frontend relying on the backend server to handle security, persistence, and business logic. This simple frontend => backend model works well for many applications, but now that our "backend" might be composed of multiple services, each with its own API and (potentially) security requirements, managing the communication between our frontend UI and our microservices can lead to a multiplication of complexity. Inter-service concerns such as security and multi-tenancy only add to the difficulty. 

In this complimentary, on-demand webinar, Zachary Klein examines some simple patterns that can help simplify your SPAs and demonstrates how to take advantage of several Micronaut features that make it easy to secure and customize the communication among your services, all the way to and from the client.

The following topics are covered in this webinar:

- Single page apps
- API gateways
- Security
- Multi-tenancy
- Token propagation
