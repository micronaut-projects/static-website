Explore multiple testing practices within Micronaut applications, including API testing, bean replacement, security testing, and more! This webinar shows you just how easy it is to test microservice applications using Micronaut's built-in tools.

Functional tests, which test the real application, run in milliseconds, thanks to Micronaut's compile-time dependency injection and AOP. This allows Micronaut developers to more easily build robust and stable applications. 

The following topics are covered in this webinar:

- Test environment
- ApplicationContext
- EmbeddedServer
- Testing endpoints with Micronaut HTTP Client
- Create and organize beans in your Test Classpath
- Data validation
- @Clients Fallbacks
- Test-specific configuration
- Testing functions
- Testing frameworks
* Spock
* JUnit
* Spek
- Micronaut Testing framework

This is a great learning opportunity for Micronaut developers interested in maximizing their productivity with the framework.

No particular expertise with Micronaut is required; however you will benefit if you're already familiar with Micronaut, Java, and how web applications work in general.
