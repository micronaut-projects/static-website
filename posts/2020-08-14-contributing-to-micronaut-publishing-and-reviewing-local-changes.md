This video is for developers that want to contribute code to Micronaut. It expects that you are familiar with concepts like snapshot versions, publishing to local and the command line.

You will learn: 

- How to create a test application with data-jdbc feature with Micronaut Launch.
- Do modifications in micronaut-sql and publish the changes to Maven Local
- Use the snapshot version on the test application.
- Explain how to force Gradle to use a specific version.
- Check that the changes done in micronaut-sql are visible on the test application.
- Do another change again in micronaut-sql, publish to Local and see that IntelliJ automatically reloads the snapshot changes.
