## OVERVIEW

Micronaut is a reflection-free app-development framework that uses ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation to precompute everything in the application, paving the way for lightning-fast startup times and significantly reduced memory consumption.

What if I told you that you can reduce the startup time by orders of magnitude? And what if you could reduce memory consumption even more?

GraalVM is a new universal virtual machine from Oracle that supports a polyglot runtime environment. GraalVM has the ability to compile Java applications down to native machine code, making it an ideal partner for Micronaut.

In this webinar, Micronaut Team member, Iv치n L칩pez, demonstrates how you can take advantage of GraalVM's powerful capabilities to convert your Micronaut applications to run as binary native images.

## OUTLINE

The following topics are covered in this webinar:

- How GraalVM works
- Why Micronaut and GraalVM work so well together
- How to convert existing Micronaut applications to GraalVM and troubleshoot problems
- How to test Micronaut and GraalVM integration

This webinar is a great introduction to GraalVM for Micronaut users and other JVM developers interested in converting their applications to GraalVM native images.
