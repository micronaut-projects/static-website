<p>The Micronaut team is excited to announce the release of Micronaut 2.4! This release features support for Jakarta inject annotations, improvements for AOP interceptor declarations, easier control over error responses, Micronaut Data improvements, and more!</p>
<h2>Jakarta Inject</h2>
<p>The Micronaut framework now supports using 'jakarta.inject' annotations as an alternative to 'javax.inject'. The javax annotations still come with the Micronaut framework by default, so in order to use the Jakarta annotations a dependency will need to be added to the build for the 'jakarta.inject-api'.</p>
<p>Future versions of the Micronaut framework will stop including javax annotations by default, and the Jakarta annotations will be included by default instead. Both annotations will continue to be supported, however.</p>
<h2>Nullability Annotations</h2>
<p>With Micronaut 2.4, we've introduced our own nullability annotations. Due to several problems with findbugs and spotbugs, no external dependency with nullable annotations will ship with future versions of the Micronaut framework. We recommend using our annotations or adding an explicit dependency on a library of your choosing for '@NonNull' and '@Nullable' annotations.</p>
<h2>Interceptor Bindings</h2>
<p>In previous versions of the Micronaut framework, an AOP annotation was responsible for declaring which interceptor should apply to it. That style of declaration is still possible with 2.4; however it is now deprecated. The new way is to allow the interceptor to define which annotations it should apply to. This has the benefit of being able to apply to multiple annotations and to annotations which may not be under your control to add the Micronaut specific AOP advice to. See the documentation on <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.4.0/guide/index.html#aop">@InterceptorBean</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>Error Responses</h2>
<p>Micronaut 2.4 makes it much easier to control responses for errors. Currently all errors are rendered as 'vnd.error' by default. If you want to use <a href="https://jsonapi.org/format/#errors">JSON API</a> or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807">Problem</a>, it is now much easier to implement that support. Future versions of the Micronaut framework may add integrations for those formats or others.</p>
<p>A common interface <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.4.0/api/io/micronaut/http/server/exceptions/response/ErrorResponseProcessor.html">ErrorResponseProcessor</a> is now responsible for creating response bodies for all provided exception handlers. See the documentation on <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.4.0/guide/index.html#errorHandling">error handling</a> for all of the details.</p>
<h2>Micronaut Data Improvements</h2>
<p>Micronaut Data now supports JDK 14+ records and persistence event methods on entities.</p>
<h2>Oracle Coherence CE</h2>
<p>Micronaut 2.4 comes with the first milestone release of Micronaut integration with Oracle Coherence Community Edition, which makes implementation of Micronaut applications with a Coherence back end a breeze. This integration comes with a ton of features including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Micronaut Data support</li>
<li>Dependency injection of Coherence-managed objects</li>
<li>Listeners for Coherence events</li>
<li>Messaging with Coherence topics</li>
<li>Caching support</li>
<li>Distributed configuration</li>
<li>HTTP sessions support</li>
</ul>

<p>The Micronaut team is excited to announce the release of Micronaut 2.3! This release features improvements to introspections and locale resolution support, support for JMS, many incremental improvements to many modules, and a startup banner!</p>
<h1>JMS</h1>
<p>Micronaut 2.3 includes a milestone version of support for JMS. Similar to our other messaging solutions, Micronaut JMS makes it easy to publish and subscribe to queues with activemq artemis, activemq classic, or Amazon SQS.</p>
<p>Simply define an interface, and it will be implemented for you to do the work of publishing the message.</p>
<pre><code>@JMSProducer(&quot;activeMqConnectionFactory&quot;)
public interface TextProducer {

    @Queue(&quot;queue_text&quot;)
    void send(@Body String body);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Create a class annotated with <code>JMSListener</code>, and the work to listen to the queue will be done for you, and your method will be called when a message arrives.</p>
<pre><code>@JMSListener(activeMqConnectionFactory)
public class TextConsumer {

    List&lt;String&gt; messages = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());

    @Queue(value = &quot;queue_text&quot;, concurrency = &quot;1-5&quot;)
    public void receive(@Body String body) {
        messages.add(body);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-jms">Github repository</a> for more information. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/elliottpope">Elliott Pope</a> for his major contributions to this area.</p>
<h1>Locale Resolution</h1>
<p>Advanced support for resolving the locale from a request has been added, and it is now possible to simply inject a <code>Locale</code> argument into controller methods. It is now possible to customize where the locale information is retrieved from. See the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#localeResolution">documentation</a> for the available configuration options.</p>
<h1>Introspections</h1>
<p>Many improvements have been made to our introspection functionality to add support for executable methods and annotation metadata on generics. This will serve as the foundation of future work to add support for the current bean validation standard and improvements to Micronaut Data.</p>
<h1>Banner</h1>
<p>A Micronaut banner will now greet you by default for applications using Micronaut 2.3. It can be customized and turned off. See the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#_micronaut_banner">documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<p>We're always excited to see how organizations use the Micronaut framework to enhance their operations.</p>
<p>For example, when <a href="https://www.smartthings.com/">SmartThings</a>, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics, had a legacy system that couldn't keep up with the requirements of its popular smart-home devices, the company's engineers turned to the Micronaut framework to build a solution.</p>
<p>By replacing its monolith architecture with a more flexible microservice-based system built with the Micronaut framework, SmartThings is moving forward with a faster, more scalable system and dramatically improving its customers' satisfaction with their smart homes.</p>

<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/maven.html"><span class="hashtag">#maven</span></a> <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/docker.html"><span class="hashtag">#docker</span></a> <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/graalvm.html"><span class="hashtag">#graalvm</span></a></p>
<p>The Micronaut 2.2 release includes version 1.1 of the
<a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-maven-plugin">Micronaut Maven Plugin</a>.
This new version of the Maven plugin includes the ability to package a Micronaut
application into different formats (fat JAR, native image, Docker, etc), generating
<code>Dockerfile</code>s, as well as pushing Docker images to different registries.</p>
<h2>mvn package all the things!</h2>
<p>There are already Maven plugins out there to produce Docker or native images,
and we could have just updated our documentation explaining how to use their
different goals. However, we thought we could do a better job, and starting with
Micronaut 2.2, <strong><code>mvn package</code></strong> is your one-stop shop for packaging your application
into different formats.</p>
<p>The way this works is via a custom lifecycle for the <code>package</code> phase in which we
cherry-pick what plugins/goals participate to produce the resulting artifact. Also,
where existing plugins didn't suffice, we implemented our own goals and added them
to the lifecycle so that <code>mvn package</code> just works for all cases. The configuration
of these plugins is defined in either the
<a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.micronaut/micronaut-parent/2.2.0/pom">Micronaut Parent POM</a>,
or the application POM generated by <a href="https://launch.micronaut.io/">Micronaut Launch</a>.</p>
<p>To determine the packaging type, you use the <code>&lt;packaging&gt;</code> tag in your POM. By
default, it is defined as <code>&lt;packaging&gt;&#36;{packaging}&lt;/packaging&gt;</code>, with a property
named <code>packaging</code> set to <code>jar</code> by default. Therefore, <code>mvn package</code> will produce
a fat JAR by default, as it was the case before. The supported packaging types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>jar</code> (default): produces a runnable fat JAR.</li>
<li><code>native-image</code>: generates a GraalVM native image.</li>
<li><code>docker</code>: builds a Docker image with the application artifacts (compiled classes, resources, dependencies, etc).</li>
<li><code>docker-native</code>: builds a Docker image with a GraalVM native image inside.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to generate a GraalVM native image, you can simply run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&#36; ./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image
</code></pre>
<p>To build a Docker image, you can choose between <code>docker</code> and <code>docker-native</code>,
depending on whether the application is executed as either JVM or native image, respectively.
The Micronaut Maven Plugin uses internally
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">Jib</a> where possible, or a
<a href="https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java">raw Docker client</a> otherwise,
to build the images.</p>
<p>Also, if you prefer, you can generate the equivalent <code>Dockerfile</code> and customise
it to your needs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&#36; ./mvnw mn:dockerfile -Dpackaging=docker-native
</code></pre>
<p>If you grab the generated <code>Dockerfile</code>, make the modifications you want, and place
it at the project's root, <code>mvn package</code> will use it for subsequent Docker builds.</p>
<p>Check the
<a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/latest/examples/package.html">Micronaut Maven Plugin packaging documentation</a>
for more information about the supported options.</p>
<h2>Pushing Docker images to Docker registries</h2>
<p>The Docker packaging options shown above will build and tag images to the local
Docker daemon. If you want to push them to remote registries, you can use
<strong><code>mvn deploy</code></strong>. The supported packaging types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>jar</code> (default): will deploy the JAR artifact to a remote repository delegating to
the <code>org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-deploy-plugin:deploy</code> goal, as it was the
case before.</li>
<li><code>docker</code> or <code>docker-native</code>: will push the Docker image to the configured Docker
registry by leveraging the Jib plugin configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to push an image to Docker Hub:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;plugin&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.cloud.tools&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jib-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;to&gt;
      &lt;image&gt;docker.io/my-company/my-app:&#36;{project.version}&lt;/image&gt;
    &lt;/to&gt;
  &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can execute <code>mvn deploy -Dpackaging=docker</code> or
<code>mvn deploy -Dpackaging=docker-native</code>. The Micronaut Maven Plugin will do a
best-effort attempt to honour credentials defined at <code>~/.docker/config.json</code>,
as well as using
<a href="https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers">credential helpers</a> such as
<code>docker-credential-gcr</code> for Google Cloudâs gcr.io and
<code>docker-credential-ecr-login</code> for Amazonâs ECR. Other credential helpers, or even
username/password authentication can be defined via the Jib plugin configuration.</p>

<a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/latest/examples/deploy.html">Micronaut Maven Plugin deploy documentation</a>
for more information about the supported options.</p>
<h2>The future ahead</h2>
<p>This is just the beginning of new awesomeness that will land into the Micronaut
Maven Plugin. The next step is to move both the Maven and
<a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin/">Gradle</a> plugins
to the same Git repository and have them share code so that they have the same features.
We hope to have this ready by Micronaut 2.3.</p>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to report issues if you find them, or feature requests,
in the
<a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-maven-plugin/issues">Micronaut Maven Plugin issue tracker</a>.
We hope you enjoy this new version!</p>]]></description><author>Ãlvaro SÃ¡nchez-Mariscal</author><guid>2020-11-23-whats-new-maven</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Micronaut 2.2 Released!</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-11-19-micronaut-22-released.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<p>The <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team">Micronaut team</a> is excited to announce the release of <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.2.0/guide/index.html">Micronaut 2.2!</a>
This release features MQTT support, packaging and configuration enhancements for the <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/1.1.0/">Micronaut Maven Plugin</a>, pushing a new project directly to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> from <a href="https://micronaut.io/launch/">Micronaut Launch</a>, a preview of R2DBC support with <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/index.html">Micronaut Data</a>, and a bunch of <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.2.0/guide/index.html#whatsNew">other enhancements</a>!</p>
<h2>MQTT</h2>
<p>Micronaut 2.2 includes a brand new configuration for <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-mqtt/latest/guide/">MQTT</a> support!
Similar to our existing <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-kafka/latest/guide/">Kafka</a> and <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-rabbitmq/latest/guide/">RabbitMQ</a> configurations, Micronaut MQTT provides support for using annotations to publish and consume data from topics that use MQTT version 3 or 5.</p>
<p>Here is an example interface that will create a MQTT publisher for a topic called <code>product</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import io.micronaut.mqtt.annotation.Topic;
import io.micronaut.mqtt.v5.annotation.MqttPublisher;

@MqttPublisher
public interface ProductClient {

    @Topic(&quot;product&quot;)
    void send(byte[] data);
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can build a subscriber for this topic using the <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-mqtt/latest/api/io/micronaut/mqtt/annotation/MqttSubscriber.html">@MqttSubscriber</a> annotation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import io.micronaut.mqtt.annotation.MqttSubscriber;
import io.micronaut.mqtt.annotation.Topic;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

@MqttSubscriber
public class ProductListener {

    List&lt;String&gt; messageLengths = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());

    @Topic(&quot;product&quot;)
    public void receive(byte[] data) {
        messageLengths.add(new String(data));
        System.out.println(&quot;Java received &quot; + data.length + &quot; bytes from MQTT&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For more information and configuration options, please see the <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-mqtt/latest/guide/">Micronaut MQTT Guide</a>!</p>
<h2>Native Image and Docker support in Maven Plugin</h2>
<p>The latest <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/1.1.0/">Micronaut Maven Plugin</a> includes first-class support for a number of packaging options including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runnable fat Jars</li>
<li>Docker Images</li>
<li>GraalVM Native Images</li>
</ul>
<p>To configure your project's runtime and preferred package, you can declare the following properties:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;project&gt;
    &lt;packaging&gt;&#36;{packaging}&lt;/packaging&gt;
    &lt;properties&gt;
        &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
        &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;
        &lt;micronaut.runtime&gt;netty&lt;/micronaut.runtime&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
    &lt;build&gt;
        &lt;plugins&gt;
            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;io.micronaut.build&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;micronaut-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/build&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, running <code>mvn package</code> will package your Micronaut project into a runnable jar that includes the Netty runtime!
To package your application as a GraalVM native image or a Docker image, you can set your <code>packaging</code> property to <code>native-image</code> or <code>docker</code>.
For a Docker image that contains a GraalVM native image, use <code>docker-native</code>.</p>
<p><code>mvn package -Dpackaging=native-image</code></p>
<p>For a full list of options and features, please see the <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/1.1.0/">Micronaut Maven Plugin documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Push to GitHub</h2>
<p><a href="https://micronaut.io/launch/">Micronaut Launch</a> learned a new trick!  Starting with version 2.2.0, you can push new Micronaut projects directly to GitHub!</p>
<p>First, select the options and features that you would like for your new Micronaut project.  Now, when you select &quot;Generate Project&quot;, pick the &quot;Push to GitHub&quot; option:</p>

<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/launch.html"><span class="hashtag">#launch</span></a></p>
<p>Back in April with the release of Micronaut 2.0 M3, we went live with a brand new implementation of the Micronaut command line interface (CLI) and <a href="https://micronaut.io/launch/">Micronaut Launch</a>, an online tool for creating Micronaut applications. Micronaut Launch features a core written in Micronaut itself and a <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/tree/master/starter-cli">micronaut-cli module that targets the user's command line</a> and uses <a href="https://picocli.info/">PicoCLI</a>.</p>
<p>Micronaut Launch has been helping you get your Micronaut apps off the ground for six months now, and we've found the data related to its use pretty interesting.</p>
<p>So, to begin, a total of 21,367 apps have been created using Micronaut Launch since its introduction on April 30th! That's about 3,561 apps a month and approximately 116 apps per day!</p>
<p>Currently, Micronaut supports JDK 8 through JDK 15. As you can see, a vast majority of you are building your Micronaut applications with JDK 11, which is the default option in the launch website.</p>
<p><img src="2020-10-30-img01.png" alt="JDKs" /></p>
<p>Micronaut Launch provides maximum flexibility to run your own version of Launch for internal teams and choose the platform (serverless or not) that best suits your needs. As a testament to Micronaut 2.0's flexibility, you can take the same application and run it across a variety of serverless platforms (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions">Google Cloud Functions</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Microsoft Azure Functions</a>, and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud-native/functions/">Oracle Cloud Functions</a>). You can also build a regular <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/tree/master/starter-web-netty">Netty</a> or Servlet application from the same codebase.</p>
<p>Below you can see which cloud deployment platforms are configured most often. AWS Lambda is the hands-down favorite.</p>
<p><img src="2020-10-30-img02.png" alt="Cloud Providers" /></p>
<p>The Micronaut Launch UI also includes support for a ton of popular features. Of all the features available, the two selected most often are <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/">Micronaut Data</a> and <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/">Micronaut Security</a>.</p>
<p>Of the build tools available through Micronaut Launch, Gradle shows 2:1 more popular than Maven. Gradle is the default build tool on the launch website.</p>
<p><img src="2020-10-30-img03.png" alt="Build Tools" /></p>
<p>As for test frameworks, JUnit is preferred by more than three quarters of users.</p>
<p><img src="2020-10-30-img04.png" alt="Test Frameworks" /></p>
<p>Finally, Micronaut apps can currently be built using Java, Kotlin, and Groovy (with Scala on the roadmap!). More than half of you prefer Java. Both Java and JUnit are the default options in the launch website.</p>
<p><img src="2020-10-30-img05.png" alt="Languages" /></p>
<p>Micronaut Launch is a fantastic example of modern application development using Micronaut. The launch application itself is a <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/">GraalVM Native Image</a> deployed as a serverless function. The new CLI build pipeline creates GraalVM native images for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The native images are then published to SDKMAN and other package managers to make installation easy. GraalVM has changed the JVM landscape for the better, and we are happy to benefit from and contribute to its success.</p>
<p>Micronaut Launch has also given us more insight into the features the Micronaut community finds most valuable and would like to see added in the future. A big thanks to everyone who has submitted issues to the launch repo to request new features, report bugs, and provide valuable feedback.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for Kotlin DSL for Gradle support, coming in November!</p>

<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/micronaut.html"><span class="hashtag">#micronaut</span></a> <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/graalvm.html"><span class="hashtag">#graalvm</span></a> <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/test.html"><span class="hashtag">#test</span></a> <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/gitlabci.html"><span class="hashtag">#gitlabci</span></a></p>
<p>Micronaut and <a href="https://www.graalvm.org">GraalVM</a> go way back. Ever since our 1.0 release back in October of 2018, Micronaut has proudly included out-of-the-box support for GraalVM and was one of the first large Java frameworks to do so.</p>
<p>I still remember the <em>early days</em> when our integration would work exceptionally for GraalVM 1.0-RC6, but then something would change in 1.0-RC7 and things would break. A while later, 1.0-RC8 would be released and everything would work great again ... until it didn't.</p>
<p>We needed to make sure we were able to test our integration before the GraalVM team released a new version. By testing early, any issues and regressions we discovered could be reported and fixed before the next release.</p>
<p>It was January 2019 (fewer than three months after we <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/2018-10-23-micronaut-10-ga-released.html">released Micronaut 1.0</a>),
and we were still using Travis CI for testing Micronaut. Travis had a lot of constraints that didn't fit well with
GraalVM. Specifically, a really low memory limit, prohibitive options for creating complex CI workflows, and no support for creating artifacts for use in later CI pipeline jobs.  We needed another way.</p>
<h2>Introducing Gitlab CI</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">Gitlab CI</a> is part of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> (although you don't need to use GitLab proper to use the CI). GitLab CI was an easy choice for me because I used it a lot in a previous job, and I really love working with it.</p>
<p>The idea was to create a CI pipeline with the following objectives in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should execute periodically instead of at each commit.</li>
<li>It should only run if there are changes in either Micronaut or GraalVM.</li>
<li>It should compile GraalVM from <code>master</code> branch, so we could detect any issue or regression as soon as possible before the next GraalVM release.</li>
<li>It should be able to test different Micronaut applications easily.</li>
<li>It should support different CI stages and jobs with some dependencies between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>After experimenting with a few different approaches in <a href="https://gitlab.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graal-tests">a new repository</a>, we were able to get a passing build using this <a href="https://gitlab.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graal-tests/-/pipelines/43802345">CI pipeline</a>:</p>
<p><img src="2020-10-12-first-ci-pipeline.png" alt="First CI pipeline" /></p>
<p>It has four stages that we still use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log-commits</strong>: Saves the commits that triggered the build for both Micronaut and GraalVM. If the build fails, we can
check those commits and see why.</li>
<li><strong>Build-graal</strong>: Clones the GraalVM repository and builds it from <code>master</code> branch. The GraalVM JDK distribution generated in
this stage is saved as an <em>artifact</em> for use in the next stage.</li>
<li><strong>Micronaut</strong>: Clones various Micronaut test applications and builds a native image using the GraalVM distribution created
in the previous stage. The native images are saved again as artifacts, so they can be used for the tests.</li>
<li><strong>Test</strong>: Starts the native images generated in the previous stage and runs some tests to make sure everything works as expected.
These tests are <code>curl</code> requests to different endpoints and we check the response.</li>
</ul>
<p>For keeping track of new commits in Micronaut and GraalVM and running the scheduled jobs, we have
<a href="https://gitlab.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graal-tests-scheduler">another companion project</a> in which we store the latest commit for both projects and decide if we should trigger the CI in the main repository.</p>
<h2>Test Applications</h2>
<p>Since our original pipeline, a lot of things have changed. Our two initial applications have become 26 test applications with 39
different jobs. This is because some of them test the same things but with different options. For example in the
<a href="https://github.com/micronaut-graal-tests/micronaut-data-jdbc-graal">Micronaut JDBC</a> test application, there are branches
for all the databases supported: H2, Postgres, Oracle, MariaDB, SQL Server, and MySQL.</p>
<p>Also, the number of jobs has been multiplied by four because we now test GraalVM for JDK 8 and JDK 11, and we also test against two Micronaut versions (currently <code>2.0.x</code> and <code>2.1.x</code>). This is how the CI pipeline looks today:</p>
<p><img src="2020-10-12-ci-pipeline-today.png" alt="CI pipeline today" /></p>
<p>Very long and beautiful list, right? ;-)</p>
<p>The list includes test applications for RabbitMQ, gRPC, Service Discovery with Consul and Eureka, Security, Micronaut
Data, Flyway, Elasticsearch, Redis, and many more. We are increasing the list with new applications, and we are
committed to support more and more things in every release.</p>
<h2>Own Runners on AWS</h2>
<p>Some months ago, we hit a limit on the Gitlab CI shared runners. A few jobs were failing when building the native
images because of an out-of-memory exception. Basically, they didn't have enough memory to build the native image, and the process failed.</p>
<p>Gitlab CI provides a way to use <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/">your own runners</a>, so we set up an
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/runner_autoscale_aws/">auto-scaling runner</a> infrastructure on AWS for
the jobs that required additional memory.</p>
<p>In order to choose the right instance type, I did some tests without limiting the number of instances launched during the auto-scale.</p>

<tr><td>c5.24xlarge</td><td>96 CPUs - 192 GB RAM</td><td>43 mins</td><td>10%</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You may wonder why using a huge instance like <code>c5.24xlarge</code> takes almost three times longer to run the CI pipeline than
the others. The answer is you can only allocate up to 512 CPUs on AWS without asking AWS support for an increase, so choosing the biggest instance allowed us to run only five of them in parallel.</p>
<p>With those numbers, it felt right to choose <code>c5.xlarge</code> because the time difference with <code>c5.2xlarge</code> was minimal, and
the former maximized the CPU usage and costs by half of the latter.</p>
<p><img src="2020-10-12-auto-scaling.png" alt="EC2 instances auto-scaling" /></p>
<p>Eventually, I moved some other jobs to run on our AWS runners because of the native image build time.
The AWS runners are so fast compared to the shared runners that they can build almost three native images in the time the shared runners
build one. With the current mix of shared and dedicated runners, the build takes around 35-40 minutes to finish.</p>
<p>Here are some of the time improvements we witnessed:</p>

<p>Configuring a job to run on our own runner is pretty simple with Gitlab. It's a matter of tagging it with <code>aws</code>, <code>memory</code>, or <code>speed</code>. I use tag combinations like <code>aws</code> + <code>memory</code>, or <code>aws</code> + <code>speed</code> as a way to document why
a specific job is running on our own runners.</p>
<p><img src="2020-10-12-runners-tag.png" alt="Runners tags" /></p>
<h2>Test dev-release Versions</h2>
<p>Some time ago the GraalVM team started to publish <a href="https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds/releases">dev-releases</a>
every few days for the community to test against, so you wouldn't have to compile everything from source yourself. They asked
us if we could verify that Micronaut was working with the latest <em>dev-release</em> just a few days before releasing a final
GraalVM version.
As we have a very granular and flexible CI pipeline, it was easy for us to add a new branch and automate the tests for
those <em>dev-releases</em>.
Now, we have a scheduled job that is executed every two or three days that automatically downloads the latest <em>dev-release</em> available
and runs all the tests with it.
For the curious, everything remains the same, and the only change is in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graal-tests/-/blob/2.1.x_dev-preview/build-graalvm.sh#L9">GraalVM build script</a> that now downloads the latest <em>dev-release</em> version.</p>
<h2>Was It Worth the Effort?</h2>
<p>What started as a small thing has evolved a lot in the past 21 months. Time has proved that it was really worth the effort
we put into this. For example, just a few days ago, the <a href="https://gitlab.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graal-tests/-/jobs/774292619">gRPC test application failed</a>,
and I was able to track down the commit that broke the build and <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2896">report an issue</a>
to the GraalVM team. Then, just a few days later, they fixed the issue and our build <a href="https://gitlab.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graal-tests/-/pipelines/199942162">is back to green</a>. :-)</p>
<p>Speaking about reporting issues, we have been working together with GraalVM to improve the GraalVM support in Micronaut,
and I've reported a lot of issues to make GraalVM better.</p>
<p><img src="2020-10-12-tweet-thomas.png" alt="Tweet Thomas Wuerthinger" /></p>
<p>We, <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team">the Micronaut team at Object Computing</a>, will continue to improve our GraalVM integration in every Micronaut release. We will also do everything we can to make integrating your Micronaut applications with GraalVM as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Our support has improved a lot in Micronaut 2.1 with the new <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin">Micronaut Gradle plugin</a>.
Take a look at <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-10-08-micronaut-gradle-plugin.html">this video</a> in which Graeme Rocher
does a demo of it.</p>
<p>For Micronaut 2.2, we also plan to release an improved version of our current <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-maven-plugin">Micronaut Maven plugin</a>,
which will include these new features as well.</p>]]></description><author>IvÃ¡n LÃ³pez</author><guid>2020-10-12-micronat-graalvm-integration</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Micronaut Gradle Plugin</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-10-08-micronaut-gradle-plugin.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.1.0/guide/index.html">Micronaut 2.1</a>!
It includes support for Kotlin 1.4, KoTest, Oracle Cloud Functions, Google Pub/Sub, and a <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.1.0/guide/index.html#whatsNew">number of other enhancements</a>.  This release also includes a brand-new Gradle plugin with a host of features for building Docker and GraalVM Native Images!</p>
<h2>New Gradle Plugin</h2>
<p>Micronaut's new <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin">Gradle plugin</a> includes first-class support for Docker and GraalVM Native Images.  It also makes it easy to configure your Micronaut runtime environment and build your application as a layered JAR.</p>
<p>Here is a sample configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">plugins {
     id 'io.micronaut.application' version '{version}'
}
repositories {
    jcenter()
    mavenCentral()
}

micronaut {
    version = &quot;2.1.0&quot; // The Micronaut Version
    runtime &quot;netty&quot; // Using the Netty runtime
}
mainClassName = &quot;example.Application&quot; // Your main class
</code></pre>
<p>This application will be built with dependencies for the Netty runtime.  Other runtime configurations are available including Tomcat, Jetty, Google Cloud Function, and Oracle Cloud Function.</p>
<p>The Gradle plugin integrates with the <a href="https://bmuschko.github.io/gradle-docker-plugin">Gradle Docker Plugin</a>, and you can build a Docker image using a layered jar by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./gradlew dockerBuild
</code></pre>
<p>If you would like to build a Docker image using a GraalVM Native Image, you can run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./gradlew dockerBuildNative
</code></pre>
<p>For a full list of supported runtimes and tasks, see the <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin/blob/master/README.md">documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>New Cloud Features</h2>
<p>Micronaut 2.1 adds improvements for Oracle Cloud and Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<h3>Oracle Functions</h3>
<p>With Micronaut 2.1, you can create Oracle Function projects by adding the <code>oracle-function</code> feature to a new project in <a href="https://micronaut.io/launch/">Micronaut Launch</a> or by passing it to the Micronaut CLI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mn create-function-app myfunction --features oracle-function
</code></pre>
<p>After some configuration updates, you can push your application image to the Oracle Container Registry using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./gradlew dockerPush` or `./gradlew dockerPushNative
</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-oracle-cloud/latest/guide/#functions">Micronaut Oracle Cloud Guide</a> for more details.</p>
<h3>Google Cloud Platform Enhancements</h3>
<p>Thanks to some amazing contributions from <a href="https://github.com/viniciusccarvalho">Vinicius Carvalho</a>, our Google Cloud Platform (GCP) support has received some enhancements.</p>
<p>First, the Micronaut GCP configuration now includes <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/latest/guide/#logging">Logging Support</a> with the new <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/latest/api/io/micronaut/gcp/logging/StackdriverJsonLayout.html">StackdriverJsonLayout</a> class that formats log output to use the Stackdriver structured format.  When used with <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/latest/guide/#tracing">Stackdriver Trace</a>, entries include a <code>traceId</code> to correlate traces to log entries.</p>
<p>Micronaut 2.1 also includes support for <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/latest/guide/#pubsub">Google Cloud Pub/Sub</a> messaging!  Once you have configured your Topics and Subscriptions in GCP, you can use them from your Micronaut applications by using the <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/latest/api/io/micronaut/gcp/pubsub/annotation/PubSubClient.html">@PubSubClient</a> annotation on an interface to create a publisher, and the <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/latest/api/io/micronaut/gcp/pubsub/annotation/PubSubListener.html">@PubSubListener</a> annotation on a class to set up subscriptions.</p>
<p>For more information about Micronaut's GCP support, see the <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/latest/guide/">Micronaut GCP Guide</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things that makes Micronaut an ideal framework for lightweight applications like microservices and serverless apps is the fact that ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation avoids runtime reflection. This allows Micronaut applications to start up really fast and consume very little memory.</p>
<p>In this webinar, Micronaut team member, <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#lopez">IvÃ¡n LÃ³pez</a>, demonstrates how IntelliJ IDEA can help developers improve their productivity when writing Micronaut applications.</p>
<p>Join IvÃ¡n and host, JetBrains Developer Advocate, Mala Gupta, to learn a variety of helpful tips for effectively building Micronaut applications with different options and features directly from the IDE using IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
<p>Topics to be covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuration auto-completion</li>
<li>Controller endpoints auto-discovery</li>
<li>HTTP client</li>

<p>Micronaut 2 includes many improvements to help you write Micronaut applications and serverless functions and deploy them to AWS Lambda.</p>
<h2>Micronaut Application Types for AWS Lambda Functions</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://launch.micronaut.io">Micronaut Launch</a>, you can select the feature <code>aws-lambda</code> for applications of type <code>Application</code> or <code>Serverless Function</code>. Those application types have their CLI-equivalent commands.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Application Type</th><th>CLI Command</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>Application</code></td><td><code>create-app</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Serverless Function</code></td><td><code>create-function-app</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>AWS Lambda Considerations</h2>
<p>To deploy an AWS Lambda function, you have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a runtime</li>
<li>Choose how your Lambda is triggered</li>
<li>Specify your Handler</li>
<li>Upload your code</li>
</ul>
<p>The above decisions influence the type of Micronaut application you choose.</p>
<h2>Select a Runtime</h2>
<p>To deploy a Micronaut function to AWS Lambda, choose an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html">AWS Lambda Runtime</a>. For Micronaut functions, select a Java (8 or 11) or custom runtime. To deploy your Micronaut function as a <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/">GraalVM Native Image</a>, select a custom runtime.</p>
<p><img src="2020-08-31-aws-lambda-runtime-java11.png" alt="Select Java 11 Corretto Runtime" /></p>
<p><img src="2020-08-31-aws-lambda-runtime-custom.png" alt="Select Custom Runtime" /></p>
<h2>Application Type, Runtime, and Dependencies</h2>
<p>Depending on your application type and runtime, you need different dependencies:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Application Type</th><th>AWS Lambda Runtime</th><th>ArtifactId</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Application</td><td>Java 8/11</td><td><code>micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Application</td><td>GraalVM Native Image in a AWS Lambda Custom Runtime</td><td><code>micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy</code>, <code>micronaut-function-aws-custom-runtime</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Serverless Function</td><td>Java 8/ 11</td><td><code>micronaut-function-aws</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Serverless Function</td><td>GraalVM Native Image in a AWS Lambda Custom Runtime</td><td><code>micronaut-function-aws</code>, <code>micronaut-function-aws-custom-runtime</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><code>micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy</code> has a transitive dependency to <code>micronaut-function-aws</code>.</p>
<p>The previous set of artifacts have a group id of <code>io.micronaut.aws</code>.</p>
<p>Micronaut CLI or Launch will include the necessary dependencies when you select the <code>aws-lambda</code> feature or both <code>aws-lambda</code> and <code>graalvm</code> features.</p>
<h2>Choose How Your Lambda Is Triggered</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html">AWS Lambda integrates with other AWS services</a> to invoke functions. The Micronaut application type you select depends on the triggers you want to support. To respond to incoming HTTP requests (e.g. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html">AWS Lambda Proxy integrations in API Gateway</a>), you can choose either <code>Application</code> or <code>Serverless Function</code>. For other triggers, such as consuming events from a queue or running on a schedule, choose <code>Serverless Function</code>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Application Type</th><th>Trigger type</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>Application</code> or <code>Serverless Function</code></td><td>HTTP requests to a single endpoint</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Application</code></td><td>HTTP requests to multiple endpoints</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Serverless Function</code></td><td>S3 events, events for a queue, schedule triggers etc.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On the one hand, if you need to support a single endpoint, a <code>Serverless Function</code> gives you a function with less code (which translates to a faster cold startup).</p>
<p>Functions written as an application of type <code>Application</code> allow you to code with a more familiar paradigm â classes annotated with <code>@Controller</code>. This is possible because, through the <code>micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy</code> dependency, Micronaut integrates with the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-java-container">AWS Serverless Java Container</a> project.</p>
<h2>Handlers</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-handler.html">AWS Lambda Function Handler</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your Lambda function's handler is the method in your function code that processes events. When your function is invoked, Lambda runs the handler method. When the handler exits or returns a response, it becomes available to handle another event.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/master/aws-lambda-java-core">aws-lambda-java-core</a> library defines two interfaces for handler methods. When coding your functions with Micronaut, you don't implement those interfaces directly. Instead, you extend or use its Micronaut equivalents:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Application Type</th><th>AWS Handler Interface</th><th>Micronaut Handler Class</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Serverless Function</td><td><a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/blob/master/aws-lambda-java-core/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/lambda/runtime/RequestHandler.java">RequestHandler</a></td><td><a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/MicronautRequestHandler.html">MicronautRequestHandler</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Serverless Function</td><td><a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/blob/master/aws-lambda-java-core/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/lambda/runtime/RequestStreamHandler.java">RequestStreamHandler</a></td><td><a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/MicronautRequestStreamHandler.html">MicronautRequestStreamHandler</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Application</td><td><code>RequestStreamHandler &lt; AwsProxyRequest , AwsProxyResponse &gt;</code></td><td><a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/proxy/MicronautLambdaHandler.html">MicronautLambdaHandler</a></td></tr>

<p>For functions of type <code>Application</code>, use the handler <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/proxy/MicronautLambdaHandler.html">io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.MicronautLambdaHandler</a>.</p>
<p>To resolve that class, add the <code>micronaut-function-aws-api-proxy</code> dependency to your build.</p>
<p>For Serverless Functions, the decision to use one <code>MicronautRequestHandler</code> or <code>MicronautRequestStreamHandler</code> depends on how you want to handle the input and output types.</p>
<p>To resolve those classes, add the <code>micronaut-function-aws</code> dependency to your build.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/MicronautRequestHandler.html">MicronautRequestHandler</a>, it is expected that you supply generic types with the input and the output types. If you wish to work with raw streams, then subclass <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/MicronautRequestStreamHandler.html">MicronautRequestStreamHandler</a> instead.</p>

<h2>Cold Startups</h2>
<p>Instances of Lambdas are added and removed dynamically.
When a new instance handles its first request, the response time increases, which is called a cold start. After that request is processed, the instance stays alive (â10 m) to be reused for subsequent requests.</p>
<p>Lambdas execution has different phases (initialization, invocation ...).</p>
<p>During the initialization phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda starts a JVM.</li>
<li>Java runtime loads and initializes handler class.</li>
<li>Lambda calls the handler method.</li>
</ul>
<p>The intialization phase has access to more CPU; because of that, Micronaut starts the application context and eagerly inits singletons during the intialization of the handler class.</p>
<h2>GraalVM and AWS Custom Runtimes</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a> is a universal virtual machine that allows you to compile Java programs to <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/">native executables</a>.</p>
<p>The introduction of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html">AWS Lambda custom runtimes</a> enables cold startup improvements for Java applications running in AWS Lambda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A runtime is a program that runs a Lambda function's handler method when the function is invoked. You can include a runtime in your function's deployment package in the form of an executable file named bootstrap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micronaut's dependency <code>micronaut-function-aws-custom-runtime</code> eases the creation of AWS Lambda Custom runtime to execute a Micronaut function.</p>
<p>The main API you will interact with is <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/runtime/AbstractMicronautLambdaRuntime.html">AbstractMicronautLambdaRuntime</a>. An abstract class that you can extend to create your custom runtime is <code>mainClass</code>. That class includes the necessary code to perform the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html#runtimes-custom-build">Processing Tasks</a> described in the Custom Runtime documentation.</p>
<p>When you generate a project with Micronaut CLI or <a href="https://launch.micronaut.io">Micronaut Launch</a> with <code>aws-lambda</code> and <code>graalvm</code> features, the output includes the necessary files to generate a ZIP file to distribute your functions as a GraalVM Native Image executed from a AWS Lambda custom runtime.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>We have written several step-by-step tutorials to get you started:</p>

<p>In years that weren't 2020, the 2GM (Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut) community typically had plenty of opportunities to chat with members of the <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team">core Grails and Micronaut team</a> at conferences and Meetups.</p>
<p>Obviously, those informal huddles in front of the room as team members pack up their materials aren't happening this year. So we're doing what we can to replicate the experience virtually.</p>
<p>On August 21st, Micronaut co-founder, Jeff Scott Brown, and Product Development Lead, James Kleeh, are hosting a virtual Q&amp;A session for Micronaut users via Zoom. Jeff and James will share an update on the improvements the team has added to the framework's latest iteration and give attendees the chance to ask questions in a relaxed environment. It'll be almost like catching up with them in the hallway after a talk ... except everyone can hear the answer ... <em>and</em> you don't have to change out of your pajamas!</p>
<p>You can reserve your spot and attend live, or sign up and watch the video recording afterwards. <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/micronaut/resources/micronaut-2-webinar">Sign up for free right here.</a></p>
<p>Obviously, if you wait for the recording, you won't get to ask your questions during the live session, but you'll still get the update and the answers to everyone else's questions.</p>]]></description><author>Kristin Kroeger</author><guid>2020-08-20-micronaut-2-qa-scheduled</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Microcast #1: Contributing to Micronaut â Publishing and Reviewing Local Changes</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-08-18-contributing-to-micronaut-publishing-and-reviewing-local-changes.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<p>In this video, IvÃ¡n LÃ³pez demonstrates how to contribute to Micronaut and test your changes locally before submitting a PR.</p>
<p>We recommend that developers who want to contribute code to Micronaut review this short video to learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Micronaut Launch data-jdbc feature to create a test application</li>
<li>Make modifications in micronaut-sql and publish the changes to Maven Local</li>
<li>Use the snapshot version on the test application</li>
<li>Force Gradle to use a specific version</li>
<li>Check that the changes made in micronaut-sql are visible on the test application</li>
<li>Make another change again in micronaut-sql, publish to Local, and see that IntelliJ automatically reloads the snapshot changes</li>
</ul>
<p>In putting together the content in this video, we assumed viewers were already familiar with concepts like snapshot versions, publishing to Local, and the command line.</p><iframe width="100%" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E1XsAoYwBrE" frameborder="0"></iframe>]]></description><author>IvÃ¡n LÃ³pez</author><guid>2020-08-18-contributing-to-micronaut-publishing-and-reviewing-local-changes</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 16:46:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Deploy Friday Webinar: Episode 16 Micronaut</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-08-11-deploy-friday-micronaut.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Thanks to its performance, low memory consumption, and lightning-fast startup time, Micronaut is particularly well-suited for services that run on serverless solutions.</p>
<p>&quot;But it takes so much time to build infrastructure,&quot; you might be thinking.</p>
<p>We get it. You don't want to let infrastructure slow down your progress.</p>
<p>But ... serverless, though.</p>
<p>So let's explore how to take advantage of readily available serverless solutions!</p>
<p>If you're ready to discover how you can relax, focus on your Micronaut code, and rapidly deploy it as a function, as an application, or within a container on Google Cloud Platform, join Google Developer Advocate, Guillaume Laforge, to get insider tips for using Cloud Functions, App Engine, and Cloud Run.</p>
<p>In this complimentary, 60-minute webinar, Guillaume demonstrates the options you have to deploy your Micronaut applications and services on Google Cloud without spending all your time on infrastructure. He covers an easy way to get started by using a Micronaut Launch template project and explains how, with just a few tweaks, you can push your code to production.</p>

<p>We at Object Computing and the Micronaut Foundation, led by Graeme and myself, remain committed to our growing community and continuing to advance what we have built here. Our focus continues to be building and helping our community create better technology.  This is what we do and will continue to do. The community is an important part of this journey for us â the most important part of the journey. Our commitment to honor and serve this community continues to grow.</p>
<p>In May of 2018 Object Computing was very happy to release MicronautÂ® to the open source community.  We grew the framework from that first milestone release, to a 1.0 release, and through a series of 1.x point releases.  Micronaut 1 has been a true game changer: the way that enterprises build microservices has changed; the way frameworks are implemented has changed; some perceptions about the JVM have even changed.</p>
<p>Micronaut 1 was truly groundbreaking.  In June of 2020 we released Micronaut 2.0, upgrading the framework to support even more integrations with cloud services, further improving performance which was already great, adding more serverless capabilities, etc.  Micronaut 2 is yet another significant leap forward.</p>
<p>Micronaut has upended how developers approach framework design in server-side Java. By shifting framework infrastructure into a compiler feature, Micronaut rewrites the book on how frameworks should be built in the post-Java EE world. Micronaut eliminates the need to use complex runtime Java container technologies to obtain features like AOP, transaction management, caching, and more. Micronaut has demonstrated that the future is intelligent compilers and smaller, faster runtimes.</p>
<p>Since inception, Micronaut has enjoyed massive enthusiasm, engagement, and adoption within the JVM community.  For example, Micronaut core has 3.8k stars on GitHub and more than 200 contributors. Micronaut is being used in production at Alibaba, Target, Minecraft, Boeing, and many other organizations.</p>
<p>We recently announced <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/news/2020/06/29/micronaut-foundation-established">The Micronaut Foundation</a>.  The foundation is supported by a Technology Advisory Board, which includes technology leaders from a number of organizations around the world and diverse segments of industry.</p>
<p>Object Computing has committed the initial funding of USD &#36;2M to fund development and evangelism of the framework through the foundation.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, we have received great enthusiasm from several technology (in particular cloud) vendors, and Oracle is among them. To support key advocates of Micronaut within Oracle, and to demonstrate the viability and stability of doubling down on Micronaut as a core component of the Oracle stack, Graeme Rocher has made the decision to join Oracle Labs, to help drive adoption and advancement of Micronaut within Oracle.</p>
<p>The Micronaut Foundation is the next step in the evolution of the framework and, we believe, of the way that software is created in the JVM ecosystem.  Through the shared insights, perspectives, and experiences of our Foundationâs Technology Advisory Board, Micronaut will be able to support more environments, more features, more developers, and more use cases than previously imagined.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will also continue to see more organizations like Object Computing invest in the future of the core framework as it continues to grow and evolve. All of us is better than any one of us.</p>]]></description><author>Jeff Scott Brown</author><guid>2020-07-02-state-of-micronaut</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Micronaut Foundation Announced</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-06-29-micronaut-foundation.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team">Micronaut team</a> at <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/micronaut">Object Computing, Inc. (OCI)</a> is proud to announce the general <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/releases/tag/v2.0.0">release</a> of Micronaut 2.0!</p>
<p>This release reflects the culmination of more than 6 months of extraordinary work from the Micronaut community. We have expanded our native image support, increased the reactive library support modules, <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/june-2020-micronaut-2-dont-let-event-loops-own-you&quot;">improved our threading model</a>, and added features that give you more service deployment options. With Micronaut 2, you can deploy nearly anywhere. From <a href="/blog/2020-03-20-micronaut-20-milestone-1-released.html">Servlet</a> to <a href="/blog/2020-04-30-micronaut-20-m3-big-boost-serverless-and-micronaut-launch.html">Serverless</a>, and practically anything in-between.</p>
<p>There's a lot to discover in Micronaut 2.0.Â  For a full list of the new features, please see the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/guide/index.html#whatsNew"><em>What's New</em> guide</a></p>
<p>Here are some highlights of what's new in Micronaut 2.</p>
<h2>MICRONAUT LAUNCH</h2>
<p>In Micronaut 2.0, we have completely rewritten the Micronaut CLI using Micronaut itself and simultaneously launched <a href="https://micronaut.io/launch/">Micronaut Launch</a>, a new tool for creating Micronaut applications that is built on the new CLI.</p>
<p>The new website and CLI are so cool, we wrote <a href="https://micronaut.io/launch/">a whole blog post</a> to introduce them!</p>
<h2>JDK 14, GROOVY 3</h2>
<p>Micronaut 2.0 now supports Java 14 and also adds support for Groovy 3.</p>

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The brochure says you can build &quot;cloud-native&quot; microservices with Micronaut ...</p>
<p>... but what does that actually mean?</p>
<p>While other frameworks may have been retrofitted to accommodate cloud deployment, Micronaut was designed with built-in support for cloud services and hosting.</p>
<p>Yep. That's right. Micronaut doesn't just allow for the development and deployment of cloud-based applications; Micronaut was actually created from the ground up to simplify the process.</p>
<p>Join Oracle Developer Advocate, Todd Sharp, in this 60-minute, complimentary webinar to learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a simple Micronaut app</li>
<li>Set up CI/CD via GitHub Actions</li>
<li>Add distributed configuration via Oracle Cloud Vault</li>
<li>Configure your application</li>
<li>Add CRUD support</li>
</ul>
<p>Todd also discusses schema migration, testing, and how you can deploy a Micronaut app to the Oracle Cloud absolutely free!</p>

<p>Micronaut Data is a database access toolkit that uses ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces that are then executed by a thin, lightweight runtime layer. Since Micronaut Data does not do any query translation at runtime, the performance gain is significant.</p>
<p>Spend an hour with Micronaut co-founder, Graeme Rocher, to learn more about this revolutionary new development tool. Learn what it's capable of and find out how to get started.</p>
<p>This is a great learning opportunity for Java developers interested in maximizing their productivity, whether they use the Micronaut framework or not. No experience with Micronaut is required; however you will benefit if you're already familiar with the JVM, web development, and data-access strategies in general.</p><iframe width="100%" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jZcHQIs8dw" frameborder="0"></iframe>]]></description><author>Graeme Rocher</author><guid>2020-05-29-meet-micronaut-data</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Micronaut now supports Microsoft Azure Functions</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-05-15-micronaut-now-supports-microsoft-azure-functions.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<li><strong>Simple Azure Functions</strong>. <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-azure/snapshot/guide/index.html#simpleAzureFunctions">io.micronaut.azure:micronaut-azure-function</a></li>
<li><strong>Azure HTTP Functions</strong>. <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-azure/snapshot/guide/index.html#azureHttpFunctions">io.micronaut.azure:micronaut-azure-function-http</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Micronaut Simple Azure Functions</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings">Azure Functions support many triggers</a> beyond HTTP, including Queue, Timer, and Blob storage. Simple Azure Functions are for these non-HTTP triggers.</p>
<p>Moreover, if your function only needs to bind to a single HTTP endpoint, you may choose Simple Azure Functions as well.</p>
<p>You can use dependency injection and validation within your functions as illustrated below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public interface NameTransformer {
   @NonNull
   String transform(@NonNull @NotBlank String name);
}

@Singleton
public CapitalizeNameTransformer implements NameTransformer {
  @Override
  @NonNull
  public String transform(@NonNull @NotBlank String name) {
      return StringUtils.capitalize(name);
  }
}

public class NameTransformFunction extends AzureFunction {
    @Inject // 1ï¸â£
    NameTransformer nameTransformer

    public String echo(
          @HttpTrigger(name = &quot;req&quot;,
                       methods = HttpMethod.GET,
                       authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
           HttpRequestMessage&lt;Optional&lt;String&gt;&gt; request,
           ExecutionContext context) {
        try {
            String name = request.getQueryParameters().get(&quot;name&quot;);
            return nameTransformer.transform(name);
        } catch(ConstraintViolationException e) { // 2ï¸â£
            return &quot;The supplied name must be not blank&quot;;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>1ï¸â£ User can dependency inject fields with <code>@Inject</code>.
2ï¸â£ <code>Name::transformer</code> parameter constraints are enforced.</p>
<h3>Micronaut Azure Http Functions</h3>
<p>If your function needs to respond to multiple HTTP endpoints, or if you want to write regular Micronaut controllers and have them executed using an Azure Function, you can choose Azure HTTP Functions.</p>
<p>With the Micronaut Azure HTTP Functions module, for the previous example, instead of NameTransformFunction, you will have a controller:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Controller(&quot;/&quot;)
public NameController {

    private final NameTransformer transformer;

    public NameController(NameTransformer transformer) { // 1ï¸â£
        this.transformer = transformer;
    }

    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    @Get
    public String index(@Nullable String name) {
        try {
            return transformer.transform(name);
        } catch(ConstraintViolationException e) {
            return &quot;The supplied name must be not blank&quot;;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>1ï¸â£ Micronaut supports constructor based injection as well.</p>
<p>In addition, testing Micronaut Azure Functions is easy. The next test shows how to test the previous controller:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class NameControllerTest {

    @Test
    public void testNameSupplied() throws Exception {
        try (Function function = new Function()) {
            HttpRequestMessageBuilder.AzureHttpResponseMessage response =
                function.request(HttpMethod.GET, &quot;/&quot;)
                        .parameter(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;sergio&quot;)
                        .invoke();
            assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatus());
            assertEquals(&quot;Sergio&quot;, response.getBodyAsString());
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Micronaut team at Object Computing is super excited to announce the <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/releases/tag/v2.0.0.M2">final milestone</a> on our journey to Micronaut 2.0.</p>
<p>This milestone focuses on two important areas of the framework: the command line interface (CLI) and serverless support.</p>
<p>For more information about all the new features, see the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0.M3/guide/index.html#whatsNew">&quot;What's New&quot; guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Introducing Micronaut Launch</h2>
<p>The big news with this announcement is the rearchitecture of Micronaut's venerable <code>mn</code> CLI for generating new applications from terminal, which is receiving a big upgrade.</p>
<p>In Micronaut 2.0, we have completely rewritten the CLI in Micronaut itself and simultaneously launched <a href="https://micronaut.io/launch/">Micronaut Launch</a>, a new tool for creating Micronaut applications that is built on the new CLI.</p>
<p>The new website and CLI are so cool, we wrote a <a href="/blog/2020-04-30-introducing-micronaut-launch.html">whole blog post</a> to introduce them!</p>
<h2>Google Cloud Function Support</h2>
<p>Micronaut 2.0 introduces support for writing applications that can be deployed to Google's upcoming <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions">Cloud Function</a> support for Java.</p>
<p>You can either write <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/2.0.x/guide/#simpleFunctions">simple functions</a> directly or write regular Micronaut controllers and have Micronaut's function support <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/2.0.x/guide/#httpFunctions">route requests to these controllers</a>. This latter approach allows you to use the regular HTTP server and also deploy the same application to Cloud Function.</p>
<p>Try it out at <a href="https://micronaut.io/launch/">Micronaut Launch</a> by choosing the <code>google-cloud-function</code> feature!</p>
<h2>Microsoft Azure Function Support</h2>
<p>In addition to Google Cloud Function, we have also added support for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Azure Function</a> using the same approach. You can either write simple functions that directly use Azure's native annotations, or you can write controllers and have Micronaut route requests from the Azure function trigger.</p>
<p>Check out the documentation for <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-azure/1.0.x/guide/#azureFunction">Micronaut Azure Function</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Try it out at Micronaut Launch by choosing the &quot;azure-function&quot; feature!</p>
<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>Micronaut 2.0 M3 is the final milestone, and we will soon start issuing release candidates, so try it out now and let us know what you think!</p>
<p>Thanks to the community for your great contributions so far; your input helped make this release happen. Enjoy!</p>]]></description><author>Graeme Rocher</author><guid>2020-04-30-micronaut-20-m3-big-boost-serverless-and-micronaut-launch</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Introducing Micronaut 2.0 Launch</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-04-30-introducing-micronaut-launch.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>
<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/launch.html"><span class="hashtag">#launch</span></a></p>
<p>With the release of <a href="/blog/2020-04-30-micronaut-20-m3-big-boost-serverless-and-micronaut-launch.html">Micronaut 2.0 M3</a>, we have gone live with a brand new implementation of the Micronaut command line interface (CLI) and <a href="https://micronaut.io/launch/">Micronaut Launch</a>, an online tool for creating Micronaut applications.</p>
<h2>A CLI History</h2>
<p>When Micronaut was first being developed, we knew we needed a tool to generate applications that allowed users to get up and running writing code without having to worry about how to configure their builds and what the dependency coordinates are. Because Micronaut relies on compile-time processing, the build setup can be slightly more complicated than a simple Java application.</p>
<p>Grails has a CLI that allows users to do just that, so we decided to fork it and copy the code into the Micronaut project. This allowed us to create a CLI with only a small amount of time required on our end to get working.</p>
<p>Over time, we discovered that the forked CLI could not meet Micronaut's needs. The Grails CLI was designed to create Groovy applications built with Gradle and tested with the Spock testing framework. Because Micronaut currently supports all combinations of Java/Groovy/Kotlin, Junit/Spock/KotlinTest, and Maven/Gradle, the number of combinations is significantly greater than what the original CLI was designed to handle.</p>
<p>In addition, the old CLI had several other shortcomings that we wanted to address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to test</li>
<li>Problematic to embed</li>
<li>Hard to produce a GraalVM native image</li>
<li>Hard to customize</li>
</ul>
<h2>Leveling Up the CLI</h2>
<p>For Micronaut 2.0, we decided it was time to rewrite the CLI in Micronaut itself (eating your own dog food, if you like) using <a href="https://picocli.info/">PicoCLI</a>. We also wanted to make it possible for the CLI to be deployed to more environments than just the user's terminal.</p>
<p>So with that, we created <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter">Micronaut Launch</a>, which is now one of the coolest projects in the Micronaut ecosystem.</p>
<p>Micronaut Launch features a <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/tree/master/starter-core">core written in Micronaut itself</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/tree/master/starter-cli">micronaut-cli module that targets the user's command line</a> and uses PicoCLI.</p>
<p>The <code>micronaut-cli</code> module uses <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/">GraalVM Native Image</a> to allow us to produce distributions of the CLI that target <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/releases/tag/v2.0.0.M3">Linux, MacOS, and Windows natively</a>.</p>
<p>Using the new CLI, you can create Micronaut applications offline or in areas of limited connectivity using a distribution that suits your platform, and thanks to GraalVM Native Image, it is lightning fast.</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-30-img01.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The new CLI features more or less the same commands as Micronaut's old CLI, but is much more optimized and fully operable offline. We have also added a few new features, with one of the coolest being the ability to display a diff of the changes required to add a new feature to an existing application:</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-30-img02.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>The Micronaut Launch API</h2>
<p>To allow users to create Micronaut applications via the web without installing the CLI, a <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/tree/master/starter-api">starter-api module</a> was created that <a href="https://launch.micronaut.io/swagger/views/swagger-ui/index.html">defines the API</a> and uses <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-openapi/">Micronaut's compilation-time OpenAPI (Swagger) specification generation</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>starter-api</code> module is then used in a number of different subprojects to allow running the API on different environments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/tree/master/starter-web-netty">starter-web-netty</a>. A Netty module that is computed into a GraalVM native image and <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Snapshot+Analytics+to+GCR%22">continuously deployed by Github Actions</a> to  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run&quot;">Google Cloud Run</a> and powers <a href="https://launch.micronaut.io">https://launch.micronaut.io</a> as a serverless application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/tree/master/starter-aws-lambda">starter-aws-lambda</a> A <a href="https://cn58jiuova.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/staging/application-types">Lambda version of the API</a> that is <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Snapshot+to+AWS+Lambda%22">continuously deployed</a> to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> and runs as a GraalVM native image using a custom runtime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/tree/master/starter-gcp-function">starter-gcp-function</a> A <a href="https://us-central1-micronaut-projects.cloudfunctions.net/micronaut-starter-staging/application-types">Cloud Function version of the API</a> that is <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Snapshot+to+GCF%22">continuously deployed</a> to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions">Google Cloud Function</a> as a serverless application using <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gcp/2.0.x/guide/#cloudFunction">Micronaut 2.0's new support for Cloud Function</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/tree/master/starter-azure-function">starter-azure-function</a> An <a href="https://micronaut-starter.azurewebsites.net/api/application-types">Azure Function version of the API</a> that is <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Snapshot+to+Azure+Function%22">continuously deployed</a> to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Microsoft Azure Function</a> as a serverless application using <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-azure/1.0.x/guide/#azureFunction">Micronaut 2.0's new support for Azure Function</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-starter/tree/master/starter-web-servlet">starter-web-servlet</a> A version of the API that can be built into a WAR file and deployed on your favorite Servlet 4+ container using <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-servlet/1.0.x/guide/">Micronaut 2.0's new support for Servlet containers</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a testament to Micronaut 2.0's flexibility that you can take the same application and run it across serverless platforms (Lambda, Azure, Cloud Function, Cloud Run) and also build a regular Netty or Servlet application from the same codebase.</p>
<p>It also provides users maximum flexibility if they wish to run their own version of Micronaut Launch for internal teams since you can now choose whichever platform (Serverless or not) that suits your needs to deploy MicronautÂ Launch to.</p>
<p>Using GraalVM Native Image, we were able to achieve average response times for a cold start of around 1.5s on Lambda and Cloud Run (billed duration of +/- 600ms for a cold start on Lambda and under a 100ms once warm), which is pretty awesome by Serverless standards.</p>
<p>The API is also accessible via CURL using <a href="https://launch.micronaut.io">https://launch.micronaut.io</a></p>
<p><img src="2020-04-30-img03.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>The Micronaut Launch UI</h2>
<p>The Micronaut Launch UI is written in <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/static-website/tree/master/main/src/main/js/start">React</a></a> and demonstrates the power of the Micronaut community. Our thanks go out to <a href="https://twitter.com/franvallano">Francisco Javier Delgado Vallano</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/maq_dev">Miguel Ãngel Quintanilla</a> from <a href="https://profile.es&quot;">Profile</a> in Spain, who built the first version of the UI based on the <a href="https://launch.micronaut.io/swagger/views/swagger-ui/index.html">OpenAPI specification</a> we provided:</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-30-img04.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Micronaut Launch UI includes some awesome features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for generating Micronaut applications, functions, CLI applications, and gRPC applications</li>
<li>The ability to preview the application that will be generated</li>
<li>The ability to show a diff for a given feature to see what changes are made to an application when a feature is applied</li>
<li>And of course, Dark Mode!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Micronaut Launch is a fantastic example of modern application development using Micronaut. The application leverages GraalVM Native Image to optimize both the CLI for each platform and the API in order to fully take advantage of GraalVM's outstanding cold start performance for CLI applications and Serverless.</p>
<p>Micronaut Launch also utilizes several of the great features we are building in Micronaut 2.0 including improved support for Serverless platforms such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Function, and Azure Function.</p>

</ul>
<p>We havenât put the final bow on Micronaut 2.0.0 yet. Stay tuned in the coming weeks for additional feature announcements and enhancements.</p>
<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>
<p>Performance has been a critical consideration of the <a href="https://micronaut.io/">Micronaut Framework</a> since its inception. Micronaut out-performs traditional Java frameworks like Spring Boot by leaps and bounds. Still, we are always looking for ways to improve Micronaut's start-up time, memory consumption, and performance.</p>
<p>Whether your application is deployed on a resource-constrained edge device, or you're looking for ways to process more requests with fewer cloud resources, modern application frameworks have to take performance seriously in order to stay competitive. Micronaut 2.0 includes some significant performance improvements over the 1.3 release, and we'd like to share some data with you comparing the performance of Micronaut 1.3.4, Micronaut 2.0.0 M2, and Spring Boot 2.2.</p>
<h2>Source Code and Instructions</h2>
<p>We are, of course, a bit biased towards our framework, so we would like to invite you to try these tests out yourself. Source code and instructions for building the projects and gathering your own results are available <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-comparisons/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Test Hardware</h2>
<ul>
<li>HP ZBook Laptop</li>
<li>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz</li>
<li>16GB of RAM</li>
<li>OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_252-b09)</li>
<li>Fedora Linux 31</li>
</ul>
<h2>Performance Measurements</h2>
<h6>UPDATE 05/29/2020</h6>
<p>A community member <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-comparisons/issues/1">pointed out</a> that the configurations for the Spring Boot JHipster Sample application and the Micronaut JHipster Sample application differed in two ways, which put Spring Boot at a disadvantage. First, the Spring Boot application had a logging level of DEBUG, causing a lot more messages to be logged. Second, the Spring Boot application was writing audit records to the database in addition to the records being created as part of the load test. We have <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-comparisons/pull/2">changed the configurations</a> and, as expected, observed an improvement in the performance of the Spring Boot application. This blog post has been updated to reflect these observations. Thank you for your feedback Christian!</p>
<h6>END UPDATE</h6>
<p>For this comparison, we investigated application start-up time, time to first response, and throughput and memory consumption of an application under load.</p>
<p>Start-up time and time to first response were measured using a simple âHello Worldâ REST application.</p>
<p>For the throughput and memory consumption measurements, we wanted to use a more substantial application than a basic Hello World, so we reached for the sample projects available through the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">JHipster</a> project. These applications include authentication and authorization, input validation, database interactions, and a number of other configurations that place them closer to the feature set of an application that you might encounter in a production environment.</p>
<p>All code was tested by executing a pre-built jar file and setting the maximum heap allocation to 128m. While Micronaut 2.0 supports JDK 14, all tests were run using OpenJDK 1.8.0_242.</p>
<h2>Start-Up Time</h2>
<p>To measure start-up time, we created three simple âHello Worldâ REST services using Spring Boot 2.2.6, Micronaut 1.3.4, and Micronaut 2.0.0 M2.</p>
<p>Micronaut and Spring Boot both report start-up time after initialization, and we used the numbers reported by the frameworks for this measurement. We started each service five times in sequence and recorded the best time for each.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Spring Boot 2.2.6</th><th>Micronaut 1.3.4</th><th>Micronaut 2.0.0 M2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>1997 ms</td><td>955 ms</td><td><b>813 ms</b></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, Micronaut 1.3.4 started up in a little under half the time of the comparable Spring Boot application, and Micronaut 2.0.0 M2 showed a nearly 15% improvement over 1.3.4!</p>
<h2>Time to First Response</h2>
<p>Once an application has started, it isnât always ready to start serving requests. The time to first response includes start-up time and any other time required to get the application ready to respond to requests.</p>
<p>To measure time to first response, we included a Node script that started a provided jar file and began issuing HTTP requests to a Hello World endpoint until one succeeded. Just as we did for start-up time, we performed this test against each service five times and recorded the best result.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Spring Boot 2.2.6</th><th>Micronaut 1.3.4</th><th>Micronaut 2.0.0 M2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>2,741 ms</td><td>1,496 ms</td><td><b>1,295 ms</b></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here we see similar results to the start-up time test. Micronaut 1.3.4 saved about 45% of the time required by Spring Boot, and Micronaut 2.0.0 M2 shaved another 200 milliseconds off that!</p>
<h2>Application Performance Under Load</h2>
<p>Start-up time is important, but load testing is much more fun. As mentioned above, rather than load test simple bare bones applications, we felt this comparison would be much more relevant if we tested applications that perform some work that a production app would do â things like performing database calls and validating input.</p>
<p>Luckily, the JHipster project includes sample applications with various configurations. For this comparison, we used the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app-micronaut">JHipster Micronaut Sample Application</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app">JHipster Spring Boot Sample Application</a>. Additionally, we included a version of the Micronaut JHipster Sample Application that had been upgraded to Micronaut 2.0.0 M2.</p>
<p>We did modify the JHipster sample applications in a significant way for this test. We replaced the code performing bcrypt encoding and verification with a no-op implementation.</p>
<p>Bcrypt, by design, is a computationally expensive calculation. That's a good thing when it comes to hashing user passwords for storage and verifying that current hashes match provided input. When it comes to measuring performance of a framework under load, it makes the results a bit less interesting.</p>
<p>To simulate load on our sample applications, we created a <a href="https://gatling.io/">Gatling</a> test suite project that simulates 1,000 users over a fixed period of 60 seconds. The scenario includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing a health check</li>
<li>Retrieving user account information</li>
<li>Creating a new bank account record in the database</li>
</ul>
<p>For each application, we recorded the number of requests completed during the 60 second test, the mean response time of all requests, and the mean requests per second that the application handled. After the load tests were completed, we recorded the amount of RSS memory consumed by the Java process running the application under load.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th></th><th>Spring Boot 2.2.5</th><th>Micronaut 1.3.4</th><th>Micronaut 2.0.0 M2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Total Requests in 60s</td><td>111,137</td><td>132,391</td><td><b>153,557</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Mean Response Time</td><td>444 ms</td><td>375 ms</td><td><b>323 ms</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Mean Requests/Second</td><td>2020.673</td><td>2407.109</td><td><b>2791.945</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>RSS Memory After Load Test</td><td>473.328 MB</td><td>435.092 MB</td><td><b>424.560 MB</b></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, under load, Micronaut 1.3.4 was able to process over 20,000 additional requests as the Spring Boot application while utilizing less memory. Micronaut 2.0.0 M2 improved on this further by shaving an additional 50 milliseconds off of the mean response time while consuming less memory than the Micronaut 1.3.4 application.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is an exciting time to be a developer in the Java ecosystem. Modern Java frameworks are challenging each other to keep pushing features and performance into previously inconceivable areas.</p>
<p>The Micronaut Team at Object Computing, works every day to improve Micronaut. We are dedicated to creating a framework that can perform under pressure and provide developers with the features and functionality they need to create fast, reliable, well-tested, and integrated applications. If you havenât taken a look at Micronaut 2.0 yet, now is a great time to investigate whatâs new in your favorite framework.</p>]]></description><author>Jason Schindler</author><guid>2020-04-28-performance-comparison-spring-boot-micronaut</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>5 Reasons You'll â¤ï¸ Using Micronaut and IntelliJ IDEA to Boost Your Productivity</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-04-16-5-reasons-to-use-micronaut-and-intellij-idea-together.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>
<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/intellijidea.html"><span class="hashtag">#intellijidea</span></a></p>
<p>I have been using IntelliJ IDEA for the last six or seven years, and I am always eager to experiment with new features when updated versions are released. When I heard a couple of months ago that JetBrains had introduced Micronaut support in IntelliJ IDEA 2020.1 EAP, I didn't think twice; I downloaded it and started using it in my current project.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I'll share the five features I like most and how they can help you improve your productivity when building Micronaut applications with IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
<h2>1. Configuration Auto-Completion</h2>
<p>Micronaut has published files containing the meta information for the configuration properties since 1.0. This file is generated automatically at compile time for any class annotated with <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code> or <code>@EachProperty</code>.</p>
<p>With this feature, you get auto-completion of the configuration properties in <code>application.yml</code>.</p>
<p>This works not only for Micronaut itself, but for any configuration that you define in your own application.</p>
<p>For example, with the following <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#immutableConfig">immutable configuration</a> in your project ...</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@ConfigurationProperties(&quot;my.engine&quot;)
public interface EngineConfig {

    /**
     * @return The manufacturer name.
     */
    @Bindable(defaultValue = &quot;Ford&quot;)
    @NotBlank
    String getManufacturer();

    @Min(1L)
    int getCylinders();

    @NotNull
    CrankShaft getCrankShaft();

    @ConfigurationProperties(&quot;crank-shaft&quot;)
    interface CrankShaft {
        Optional&lt;Double&gt; getRodLength();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>â¦ you get these auto-completions.</p>
<p>Even the default values for the properties and the javadoc comments are displayed.</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-16-img01.png" alt="configuration auto-completion" /></p>
<h2>2. Endpoints Discovery</h2>
<p>You're likely to find it really helpful to have a clear picture of all the endpoints in your application. You can click on the âEndpointâ button at the bottom of the screen to activate it.Â </p>
<p>There are a few configuration options to display exactly what you would like to see. These options include showing the endpoints from the framework (like management endpoints if you have them), grouping by client/server, and much more!Â </p>
<p>Additionally, if you double-click on an endpoint, the controller method is opened in the editor.</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-16-img02.png" alt="Endpoints Discovery" /></p>
<h2>3. Controllers and HTTP Requests</h2>
<p>When interacting with our Micronaut applications, sometimes we use tools like <code>curl</code> to send HTTP requests. This is fine, but it means we must go &quot;out&quot; of our IDE, and we lose some of the features and shortcuts we're used to.</p>
<p>Let's imagine we have an encryption-service that receives some text and encrypts it. To make things simple, the encryption logic in the <code>EncryptionService</code> just reverses the string:</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-16-img03.png" alt="Controllers and HTTP Requests" /></p>
<p>If we click on the icon in the gutter, IntelliJ IDEA automatically generates an &quot;http-requests&quot; file with the endpoint set and ready to send a test request:</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-16-img04.png" alt="HTTP Requests File" /></p>
<p>Take a look at the examples to see how to customize the requests, define authentication, and other useful tasks.</p>
<h2>4. Event Publishing and Listeners</h2>
<p>Sometimes we publish an event in our applications when something happens, and then we subscribe for that event in other parts of the code. But you may find it tricky to know exactly when that happens.</p>
<p>Not anymore!Â </p>
<p>Clicking on this new icon in the gutter navigates to the listener:</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-16-img05.png" alt="Event Publishing and Listeners Image 1" /></p>
<p><img src="2020-04-16-img06.png" alt="Event Publishing and Listeners Image 2" /></p>
<h2>5. Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Besides the things I've already highlighted, other new features include new icons in the gutter, navigation to services injected as constructor arguments, and more.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The Micronaut team has been extremely pleased with the superb efforts JetBrains has made in incorporating support for Micronaut into IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-222224">support for Micronaut Data</a> in a future IntelliJ IDEA release.</p>]]></description><author>IvÃ¡n LÃ³pez</author><guid>2020-04-16-5-reasons-to-use-micronaut-and-intellij-idea-together</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Grails and Micronaut Product Teams Announce Expansion of Leadership</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-04-16-grails-and-micronaut-product-teams-announce-expansion-leader.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/aws.html"><span class="hashtag">#aws</span></a> <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/corretto.html"><span class="hashtag">#corretto</span></a></p>
<p>One practice used by the <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team" title="Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut Team">Micronaut development team</a> is continuous integration (CI). In support of this, the <a href="https://micronaut.io/" title="Learn more about the Micronaut Framework">Micronaut framework</a>'s core has an extensive test suite executed via <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, and since the beginning of 2020, tests have also been executed with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/">Amazon Corretto</a> 8 and 11.</p>
<p>Users can now be assured that Micronaut is certified to run on Amazon Corretto, and we will continue our partnership with Amazon to ensure users don't run into any issues in production.</p>
<p>Amazon Corretto is an OpenJDK distribution that provides free, long-term support with no pay-gated features or restrictions on how it's used in production. Corretto is used by thousands of Amazon workloads; for example, it's the JDK used by the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/java-11-runtime-now-available-in-aws-lambda/">AWS Lambda <code>java11</code> runtime</a>, which provides insights Amazon uses to push improvements upstream.</p>
<p>Since Micronaut offers <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide">first-class support for AWS</a>, particularly for Lambda functions, we thought it prudent to include a specific workflow to run Micronaut core tests with Corretto. We are also making sure that tests are run within an Amazon Linux 2 base image, which is the environment users will find in a java11 runtime-based Lambda.</p>
<p>To enable the Micronaut team to continuously test and support Micronaut running on Corretto, we use the official <code>amazoncorretto:8</code> and <code>amazoncorreto:11</code> Docker images, which are built on top of <code>amazonlinux:2</code>.</p>
<p>With the exception of some environment variables (which may be specific to the use case of running within GitHub Actions and within a Docker image), Corretto has proven to be a drop-in replacement for other OpenJDK distributions. It has not produced any difference compared to the main CI workflow, which is run with GitHub Actions' default Zulu Community distribution of OpenJDK. You can check the whole workflow file <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/blob/master/.github/workflows/corretto.yml">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Choosing Corretto</h2>
<p>If you wish to use Corretto locally as your OpenJDK distribution, you can download it from <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html">Amazon's downloads page</a>. Alternatively, installation can be greatly simplified using <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN!</a>, which makes the process of switching between Java distributions and versions a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Once you have SDKMAN! Installed, you can install and use Corretto 11 by simply typing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&#36; sdk install java 11.0.6-amzn
&#36; sdk use java 11.0.6-amzn
</code></pre>
<p>Then, check the version used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&#36; java -version
openjdk version &quot;11.0.6&quot; 2020-01-14 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-11.0.6.10.1 (build 11.0.6+10-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-11.0.6.10.1 (build 11.0.6+10-LTS, mixed mode)
</code></pre>
<p>And youâre done!</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The Micronaut team is continually looking at ways to improve and validate the Micronaut framework against production cloud environments like Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>While Amazon Corretto is not strictly a user-facing feature, users can forge ahead with Micronaut and AWS with the assurance that the technologies are certified to work together.</p>

<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/springboot.html"><span class="hashtag">#springboot</span></a> <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/quarkus.html"><span class="hashtag">#quarkus</span></a> <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/jdk14.html"><span class="hashtag">#jdk14</span></a></p>
<p>After the recent releases of Micronaut 2.0 M2 and JDK 14, I decided it would be a good time to see what the state of play is performance wise between Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot on JDK 14 in 2020.</p>
<p>Historically, we have encouraged users to make their own judgments, but recently some incorrect or distorted information has been published, and I think it's important that I clarify some points that may be confusing or misleading. For example, if you search for &quot;Micronaut vs Quarkus&quot; on Google, the first result it serves up is <a href="https://simply-how.com/quarkus-vs-micronaut">a blog post</a> that contains benchmarking data that none of the Micronaut team has been able to replicate with any recent version of Micronaut on a variety of systems.</p>
<p>So to ensure there is more accurate information out there, and also to show users how to compare these frameworks in an &quot;apples-to-apples&quot; manner (since each framework's default configuration is different), I decided to take for a spin the latest versions of the three most-hyped frameworks among Java developers today: Micronaut, Quarkus and Spring Boot.</p>
<p>Before getting started, we acknowledged that this cannot help but be a somewhat biased analysis, given that Object Computing is the home of Micronaut. To mitigate this bias, we attempted to make the comparison as transparent as possible by performing testsÂ that users can replicate at home, and to conduct them live in a completely unedited screencast. You can watch that screencast here:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/rJFgdFIs_k8" title="Micronaut vs Quarkus vs Spring Boot Performance on JDK 14"><img src="2020-04-07-img01.gif" alt="Micronaut vs Quarkus vs Spring Boot Performance on JDK 14" /></a></p>
<p>For reference, the source code for the examples built during the recording of this screencast can be <a href="https://github.com/graemerocher/framework-comparison-2020">found on Github</a>.</p>
<h2>Summary of Results</h2>
<p>Following are the stats that were produced during the recording of this screencast for the different metrics we tested (winner in red), taking the averages over 10 runs:</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-07-img02.jpeg" alt="Summary of Results" /></p>
<h6>UPDATE</h6>
<p>The response from the Spring team was to use <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta">vegata</a> to benchmark instead. Quarkus appears to be the winner at higher concurrency when testing with wrk whilst Micronaut appears to be the winner with vegata. This proves once again do your own benchmarking with a variety of tools!</p>
<h6>END UPDATE</h6>
<p>As you can see, as of today, if you are looking at performance, Quarkus is marginally ahead on time to first response (around 70ms), while the only metric Spring Boot wins is compilation time due to not doing any compilation-time processing.</p>
<p>With regard to Spring Boot, we were unable to extract reliable request-per-second data because Spring's Netty implementation bizarrely doesn't seem to support keep-alive connections correctly. Of course this may be something that we are doing wrong on our side, so please feel free to leave a comment on the video if any Spring users know the solution.</p>
<p>The Quarkus team has made bold claims about the memory efficiency of Quarkus, so it was surprising to see such a disparity when actual tests were conducted that seem to disprove these claims.Â The Micronaut team and I are disappointed that we had to take it upon ourselves to perform these tests and publish the results, not as a simple opportunity to help others improve their processes and applications, but to respond to misinformation that could, theoretically, do the opposite.Â </p>
<p>We are all extremely proud of Micronaut, and we know users have been happy with its powerful capabilities. We listen to feedback and work every day on making improvements that we hope will help even more people enhance their productivity and build faster, better apps. That said, I encourage all users to do their own testing and make their own judgments regarding which JVM framework they prefer.</p>]]></description><author>Graeme Rocher</author><guid>2020-04-07-micronaut-vs-quarkus-vs-spring-boot-performance-jdk-14</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Single Page Apps for a Microservice Architecture</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-04-02-single-page-apps-for-microservice-architecture.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<p>Single-page applications (SPAs) are typically built as dynamic clients that interact with your web application through REST or some other HTTP-friendly protocol, with the frontend relying on the backend server to handle security, persistence, and business logic. This simple frontend =&gt; backend model works well for many applications, but now that our &quot;backend&quot; might be composed of multiple services, each with its own API and (potentially) security requirements, managing the communication between our frontend UI and our microservices can lead to a multiplication of complexity. Inter-service concerns such as security and multi-tenancy only add to the difficulty.</p>
<p>In this complimentary, on-demand webinar, Zachary Klein examines some simple patterns that can help simplify your SPAs and demonstrates how to take advantage of several Micronaut features that make it easy to secure and customize the communication among your services, all the way to and from the client.</p>
<p>The following topics are covered in this webinar:</p>

<p>Beyond the features <a href="/blog/2020-03-20-micronaut-20-milestone-1-released.html">already introduced in Milestone 1</a>, the second milestone features the following three additional themes.</p>
<h2>A Love Letter to Maven Users</h2>
<p>The Micronaut team loves Gradle; hence it's the default build system for new Micronaut projects. However, Maven usage is huge, and Maven is great too, so we wanted to make sure Maven users have a great experience with Micronaut, as well.</p>
<p>We have always supported building with Maven by using <code>mn create-app myapp --build maven</code> to create your application. Now however, thanks to the great work of Alvaro Sanchez-Mariscal of the Micronaut team, we are happy to introduce the <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/latest/">Micronaut Maven Plugin</a>, as well as new parent POMs for Maven projects.</p>
<p>With the Micronaut Maven plugin, you can run your Micronaut application and have changes instantaneously reloaded:</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-02-img01.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In addition to this awesomeness, a new <code>micronaut-parent</code> POM is published that users can include as a parent to any <code>pom.xml</code> file. This will automatically configure the Micronaut Maven plugin.</p>
<h2>New Reactive Modules</h2>
<p>Thanks to the Reactive Streams specification, there are a whole bunch of reactive libraries out there that work well with Micronaut. In addition, newer libraries are coming out all the time, including <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What%27s-different-in-3.0">RxJava 3</a>.</p>
<p>Micronaut 2.0 comes with new <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.x/guide/index.html#reactiveConfigs">reactive modules</a> that you can add to your classpath that allow you to choose between RxJava 1, RxJava 2, RxJava 3, and Reactor.</p>
<h2>Significant Startup Improvements</h2>
<p>We have continued to make improvements that make Micronaut more and more useful for serverless use cases. For example, you now have the ability to eagerly initialize beans on AWS Lambda, and we've improved Micronaut's overall startup time by between 20% and 30% over Micronaut 1.x</p>
<h2>More to Come</h2>
<p>Micronaut 2.0 Milestone 2 follows hot in the heels of M1, and we're not done yet! Expect big improvements to Micronaut's serverless support in the next milestone before we start with the RC stage.</p>
<p>Thanks to the community for your great contributions so far; your input helped make this release happen. Enjoy!</p>]]></description><author>Graeme Rocher</author><guid>2020-04-02-micronaut-20-milestone-2-massive-maven-improvements</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Micronaut 2.0 Milestone 1 Released</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-03-20-micronaut-20-milestone-1-released.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>
<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/release.html"><span class="hashtag">#release</span></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team" title="Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut Team">Micronaut Team</a> at <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/">Object Computing, Inc.</a> (OCI) is pleased to announce the <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/releases/tag/v2.0.0.M1">first milestone of Micronaut 2.0</a>!</p>
<p>Micronaut 2.0 represents the next evolution of Micronaut and focuses on the following key new features:</p>
<h2>Support for HTTP/2</h2>
<p>Support for HTTP/2 has been added and can be optionally enabled in both the Netty-based HTTP server and client.</p>
<p>Getting started with HTTP/2 support is as simple as enabling it in your application configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># application.yml
micronaut:
  server:
      http-version: 2.0
</code></pre>
<h2>Servlet Support</h2>
<p>Micronaut can now go places that weren't possible before, including your favorite servlet container! <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-servlet">Embedded servers for Jetty, Tomcat, and Undertow</a> are included and can be activated via the command line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&#36; mn create-app myapp --features jetty-server
</code></pre>
<p>Using Micronaut's support for GraalVM, you can generate a native image of any Tomcat or Jetty application!</p>
<h2>Threading Model Improvements</h2>
<p>A big change from Micronaut 1.x are the improvements to the threading model, including the ability to explicitly configure and share Netty EventLoopGroup instances and more effectively take advantage of the EventLoop programming model.</p>
<p>The improvements to the threading model allow Micronaut to more effectively conserve resources in environments where resources are limited, such as IoT devices.</p>
<h2>Server-Side Content Negotiation Improvements</h2>
<p>Micronaut's support for server-side content negotiation has been greatly improved, allowing users to more effectively support both XML and JSON responses.</p>
<h2>And Lots More</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release, from support for <a href="https://jdbi.org/">Jdbi</a> to improved support for Cloud Foundry. We recommend you checkout the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.x/guide/index.html#whatsNew">release notes in full</a> for all the details.</p>
<h2>More to Come</h2>
<p>Micronaut 2.0 Milestone 1 is just the first milestone on Micronaut's journey towards 2.0. It gives users the opportunity to take important new features like HTTP/2 support out for spin and provide feedback to make the GA release as solid as possible.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team" title="Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut Team">Micronaut Team</a> at <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/">Object Computing, Inc.</a> (OCI) is pleased to announce the first milestone of <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-servlet">Micronaut Servlet</a>, a new implementation of Micronaut that runs on traditional Java servlet containers.</p>
<p>Micronaut Servlet provides support for replacing the Netty-based HTTP server that comes with Micronaut with either <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/">Jetty</a>, <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>, or <a href="http://undertow.io">Undertow</a>, which may be of interest to those who are already familiar with the thread-per-request model of traditional servlet containers and have an existing large investment in the servlet ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-servlet/1.0.x/guide/#jetty">Jetty</a> and <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-servlet/1.0.x/guide/#tomcat">Tomcat</a> implementations can be used with <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM native image</a> to produce native servlet applications that start in milliseconds and consume very little memory.</p>
<p><a href="https://grails.org/">Grails</a> users also stand to benefit in the future by allowing Micronaut to run side-by-side, embedded within an existing Grails servlet-based application.</p>

<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/aop.html"><span class="hashtag">#aop</span></a></p>
<p>With the recent release of <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/releases/tag/v1.0.0.M2">Micronaut Data 1.0 M3</a>, I got to work on a couple of features for Micronaut Data that really highlighted to me what we have achieved with <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#aop">Micronaut's aspect-oriented programming (AOP) API</a> and the fantastic simplifications it offers, while at the same time ensuring optimal performance. I thought I would take the time to do a write-up of how Micronaut AOP works and why it is one of my favorite Micronaut features compared to the competitors.</p>
<h2>Introduction to AOP</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, AOP has a long history in the Java community, with a variety of different implementations, including a custom Java language extension called <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/">AspectJ</a>. The basic idea is that in a Java application, you often want to apply cross-cutting logic to a method invocation. The way you apply this cross-cutting logic could be expressed in a custom language like AspectJ; however most developers are exposed to AOP via annotations, where you explicitly apply AOP &quot;advice&quot; to a method.</p>
<p>The most famous example of this in the Java community is probably Spring's <code>@Transactional</code> annotation, which allows you to demarcate a method as running within the context of a declared transaction. This is what is known as &quot;Around Advice,&quot; where you decorate a method invocation with new behavior that implements a cross-cutting concern.</p>
<p>Around Advice is just one type of AOP Advice supported by Micronaut. The following advice types are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#aroundAdvice">Around Advice</a>.</strong> As described previously, you decorate an existing method with new behavior.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#introductionAdvice">Introduction Advice</a>.</strong> Introduction Advice differs, in that it allows you to introduce new behavior to an existing class. A great example of this is, in fact, Micronaut Data (and Spring Data), which allows you to declare an interface that the compiler implements for you by introducing new behavior.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#adapterAdvice">Adapter Advice</a>.</strong> Adapter Advice is, I believe, unique to Micronaut in that it allows you to introduce a new bean that implements SAM type, an interface with a single abstract method, and delegates to any method definition. This may sound confusing, but shortly I will present a concrete example of this in action.</li>
</ul>
<p>So why does Micronaut implement its own AOP mechanism, rather than rely on something already out there?</p>
<p>Existing implementations for both Java/Jakarta EE and Spring rely heavily on a mixture of runtime reflection, JDK proxies, and byte code generation with something like CGLib or Bytebuddy (even Quarkus currently only implements reflection-free DI and not AOP).</p>
<p>Micronaut dependency injection is completely reflection free, so it made sense for Micronaut's AOP mechanism to be reflection free as well.</p>
<h2>Micronaut AOP Setup</h2>
<p>Micronaut AOP is incredibly simple to use when compared to other implementations out there. It is literally just a compiler feature. There is no need to set up complex ProxyFactoryBean implementations or rely on a runtime container. The minimum set of requirements to get going with Micronaut AOP is to add the Micronaut annotation processors and declare a dependency on micronaut-aop in your build.</p>
<p>The following is the Gradle configuration required:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">dependencies {
     annotationProcessor &quot;io.micronaut:micronaut-inject-java:&#36;micronautVersion&quot;
     compile &quot;io.micronaut:micronaut-aop:&#36;micronautVersion&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the equivalent Maven config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;io.micronaut&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;micronaut-aop&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;&#36;{micronaut.version}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
....
    &lt;pluginManagement&gt;
      &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
          &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
          &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
          &lt;version&gt;3.7.0&lt;/version&gt;
          &lt;configuration&gt;
            &lt;source&gt;&#36;{jdk.version}&lt;/source&gt;
            &lt;target&gt;&#36;{jdk.version}&lt;/target&gt;
            &lt;encoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/encoding&gt;
            &lt;compilerArgs&gt;
              &lt;arg&gt;-parameters&lt;/arg&gt;
            &lt;/compilerArgs&gt;
            &lt;annotationProcessorPaths&gt;
                  &lt;path&gt;
                    &lt;groupId&gt;io.micronaut&lt;/groupId&gt;
                    &lt;artifactId&gt;micronaut-inject-java&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                    &lt;version&gt;&#36;{micronaut.version}&lt;/version&gt;
                  &lt;/path&gt;
            &lt;/annotationProcessorPaths&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The Maven configuration requires you declare the micronaut-inject-java dependency in your annotation processors paths from the Maven compiler plugin.</p>
<h2>Micronaut Around Advice Put to Use</h2>
<p>So as mentioned at the beginning of the article, I got to use some of the Micronaut AOP features with Micronaut Data, since we wanted to support transaction management, as well as transactional events, without the need to pull in Spring, which adds overhead by introducing an additional 4mb of dependencies, makes extensive use of reflection and runtime proxies, which impact memory consumption, and negatively impacts GraalVM native support.</p>
<p>The first step was to add support for <code>javax.transaction.Transactional</code> so you could use the standard Java annotation to declare transaction boundaries. To achieve this, I created a new annotation called <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/blob/master/data-tx/src/main/java/io/micronaut/transaction/interceptor/annotation/TransactionalAdvice.java">TransactionalAdvice</a>, which I declared as a meta-annotation (an annotation that can be used only on other annotations):</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Target(ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Around
@Type(TransactionalInterceptor.class)
@Internal
public @interface TransactionalAdvice {
    /**
     * Alias for {@link #transactionManager}.
     *
     * @return The transaction manager
     * @see #transactionManager
     */
    String value() default &quot;&quot;;

    // Remaining members omitted for clarity

}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>TransactionalAdvice</code> annotation is itself annotated with <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/aop/Around.html">@Around</a> and <code>@Type(TransactionalInterceptor.class)</code>, which indicate the interceptor type that will handle the method invocation.</p>
<p>To make it possible to activate the <code>TransactionAdvice</code> behavior every time someone uses <code>javax.transaction.Transactional</code>, I then added a <code>AnnotationMapper</code> that the compiler will use to map the <code>javax.transaction.Transactional</code> annotation to the <code>TransactionAdvice</code> annotation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class JtaTransactionalMapper implements NamedAnnotationMapper {
    @NonNull
    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return &quot;javax.transaction.Transactional&quot;;
    }

    @Override
    public List&lt;AnnotationValue&lt;?&gt;&gt; map(AnnotationValue&lt;Annotation&gt; annotation, VisitorContext visitorContext) {

        AnnotationValueBuilder&lt;Annotation&gt; builder =
                AnnotationValue.builder(&quot;io.micronaut.transaction.interceptor.annotation.TransactionalAdvice&quot;);

        // Member processing omitted for brevity....

        return Collections.singletonList(
                builder.build()
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The above annotation mapper will be triggered every time a <code>@Transactional</code> annotation is declared in code. The map method returns the meta annotation that the annotation maps to.</p>
<p>The motivation to use a meta-annotation and map existing annotations is that you can support any annotation type, including Spring's. Additionally, if one day <code>javax.transaction</code> is renamed to <code>jakarta.transaction</code>, we just add a new mapper that has zero runtime overhead. It allows Micronaut to completely decouple itself from the source code annotation DSL used.</p>
<p>So what about the <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/blob/master/data-tx/src/main/java/io/micronaut/transaction/interceptor/TransactionalInterceptor.java">TransactionInterceptor</a> implementation?</p>
<p>Micronaut AOP defines an interface called <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/aop/MethodInterceptor.html">MethodInterceptor</a> that features a single method called <code>intercept</code> that all interceptors need to implement. The intercept method receives a reference to the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/aop/MethodInvocationContext.html">MethodInvocationContext</a> that holds a reference to the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/inject/ExecutableMethod.html">ExecutableMethod</a> that you can use to proceed and invoke the original implementation.</p>
<p>The received <code>ExecutableMethod</code> is a compile-time-produced handle that allows you to invoke the original method without using reflection. It also contains a reference to the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/core/annotation/AnnotationMetadata.html">AnnotationMetadata</a>, which allows you to inspect and retrieve annotation values and stereotypes without using reflection. The benefits of this include massively reduced stack trace sizes, improved performance, and reduced memory consumption.</p>
<p>The following is the implementation taken from the <code>TransactionInterceptor</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">public Object intercept(MethodInvocationContext&lt;Object, Object&gt; context) {
    final TransactionInvocation transactionInvocation = transactionInvocationMap
            .computeIfAbsent(context.getExecutableMethod(), executableMethod -&gt; {
        final String qualifier = executableMethod.stringValue(TransactionalAdvice.class).orElse(null);
        SynchronousTransactionManager transactionManager =
                beanLocator.getBean(SynchronousTransactionManager.class, qualifier != null ? Qualifiers.byName(qualifier) : null);
        final TransactionAttribute transactionAttribute = resolveTransactionDefinition(executableMethod);

        return new TransactionInvocation(transactionManager, transactionAttribute);
    });
    final TransactionAttribute definition = transactionInvocation.definition;
    final SynchronousTransactionManager transactionManager = transactionInvocation.transactionManager;
    final TransactionInfo transactionInfo = createTransactionIfNecessary(
            transactionManager,
            definition,
            definition.getName());
    Object retVal;
    try {
        retVal = context.proceed();
    } catch (Throwable ex) {
        completeTransactionAfterThrowing(transactionInfo, ex);
        throw ex;
    } finally {
        cleanupTransactionInfo(transactionInfo);
    }
    commitTransactionAfterReturning(transactionInfo);
    return retVal;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The important aspects start on line 4, where the annotation metadata is inspected to figure out which transaction manager to look up to apply transaction management.</p>
<p>On line 13, a transaction is created. We then proceed within the method invocation on line 19 and finally return the value on line 27. The code here is largely based on the equivalent code in Spring's <code>TransactionAspectSupport</code>, but without needing all of the runtime proxy and reflection complexity.</p>
<p>And with that, whenever you declare <code>@Transactional</code> in your code, you get automatic transaction management. Nothing else to configure. How simple is that?</p>
<h2>Micronaut Introduction Advice Put to Use</h2>
<p>Another feature requested by Micronaut users is the ability get a reference to a <code>java.sql.Connection</code> that is aware of the currently executing transaction. The solution for this in Spring is <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy.html">TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy</a>, which proxies your entire <code>java.sql.DataSource</code>, making sure whenever you retrieve a connection, it is associated with the current transaction. But this adds the overhead of runtime reflection and proxying to all methods of the <code>DataSource</code> interface.</p>
<p>To support this use case without proxying the <code>DataSource</code>, with Micronaut Data we decided to allow users to inject a transaction-aware <code>java.sql.Connection</code> in a similar way you can inject a transaction-aware <code>EntityManager</code> in JPA that uses Hibernate's <code>getCurrentSession()</code> feature.</p>
<p>This turned out to be really simple with Micronaut AOP. The first step was to define an interface that extended <code>java.sql.Connection</code>, which I called <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/blob/master/data-tx/src/main/java/io/micronaut/transaction/jdbc/TransactionalConnection.java">TransactionalConnection</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package io.micronaut.transaction.jdbc;

import io.micronaut.context.annotation.EachBean;
import javax.sql.DataSource;
import java.sql.Connection;

@EachBean(DataSource.class)
@ConnectionAdvice
public interface TransactionalConnection extends Connection {
}
</code></pre>
<p>The interface is annotated on line 7 with another of my favorite Micronaut features, the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/context/annotation/EachBean.html">@EachBean</a> annotation, which says that for every <code>DataSource</code> bean configured in the application, create an associated <code>TransactionalConnection</code> bean. This effectively means if you have multiple data sources, you get a <code>TransactionalConnection</code> bean configured for each one automatically and use a <code>javax.inject.Named</code> qualifier to inject the one you want.</p>
<p>The Introduction Advice is then defined on line 8 using a new annotation called <code>@ConnectionAdvice</code>, which is a package private internal annotation and looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Introduction
@Type(ConnectionInterceptor.class)
@Internal
@interface ConnectionAdvice {
}
</code></pre>
<p>On line 3, we define the annotation as <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/aop/Introduction.html">@Introduction</a> Advice, which means it can implement abstract behavior.</p>
<p>On line 4, we define the interceptor that is going to provide the implementation at runtime, which in this case is <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/blob/master/data-tx/src/main/java/io/micronaut/transaction/jdbc/ConnectionInterceptor.java">ConnectionInterceptor</a>, which is shown below and is really simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">public final class ConnectionInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor&lt;Connection, Object&gt; {

    private final DataSource dataSource;

    ConnectionInterceptor(BeanContext beanContext, Qualifier&lt;DataSource&gt; qualifier) {
        this.dataSource = beanContext.getBean(DataSource.class, qualifier);
    }

    public Object intercept(MethodInvocationContext&lt;Connection, Object&gt; context) {
        Connection connection;
        try {
            connection = DataSourceUtils.getConnection(dataSource, false);
        } catch (CannotGetJdbcConnectionException e) {
            throw new NoTransactionException(&quot;No current transaction present. Consider declaring @Transactional on the surrounding method&quot;, e);
        }
        return context.getExecutableMethod().invoke(connection, context.getParameterValues());
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>On line 6 we used the injected qualifier for the interceptor instance to look up the associated <code>DataSource</code>. Then on line 12 we look up the connection associated with the current transaction. If no connection is present, we throw <code>NoTransactionException</code> on line 14. Otherwise we proceed and invoke the method on the connection on line 16.</p>
<p>With that in place, all a user has to do is inject a Connection instance and use it directly, rather than having to manually look up the connection associated with the current transaction, which simplifies the code quite nicely:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Inject
Connection connection;

@Transactional
void insertWithTransaction() throws Exception {
    try (PreparedStatement ps = connection
            .prepareStatement(&quot;insert into book (pages, title) values(100, 'The Stand')&quot;)) {
        ps.execute();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The underlying connection is managed by the transaction and cleaned up and closed after the transaction commits, so there is no need to close it manually. If one were to remove the <code>@Transactional</code> definition, a <code>NoTransactionException</code> would occur.</p>
<h2>Micronaut Adapter Advice Put to Use</h2>
<p>Both Micronaut and Spring allow the publication of events that can be consumed by either synchronous or asynchronous event listeners.</p>
<p>One missing feature from Micronaut, which users have been asking for a lot, is the ability to define transactional event listeners. That is, event listeners that are only triggered when a particular transaction phase completes (typically users are most interested in triggering behavior after a successful commit). The use cases here are things like sending an email or publishing a Kafka message only if a transaction commits successfully.</p>
<p>Making this work in Micronaut was actually remarkably simple thanks to <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#adapterAdvice">Adapter advice</a>.</p>
<p>The first step was defining a <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/blob/master/data-tx/src/main/java/io/micronaut/transaction/annotation/TransactionalEventListener.java">@TransactionalEventListener</a> annotation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Documented
@Adapter(ApplicationEventListener.class)
@TransactionalEventAdvice
public @interface TransactionalEventListener {
    TransactionPhase value() default TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMMIT;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The first important part is the definition in the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/aop/Adapter.html">@Adapter</a> annotation on line 4, which takes the interface we want to adapt, in this case <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/context/event/ApplicationEventListener.html">ApplicationEventListener</a>.</p>
<p>Interfaces passed to the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/aop/Adapter.html">@Adapter</a> annotation have to contain a Single Abstract Method (often called SAM types). At compilation time, Micronaut will create an additional bean that implements the interface and delegates to the method that declares the annotation. So in this case a new <code>ApplicationEventListener</code> bean will be created that invokes the method that <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/blob/master/data-tx/src/main/java/io/micronaut/transaction/annotation/TransactionalEventListener.java">@TransactionalEventListener</a> is declared on.</p>
<p>The nice thing is that if you try to declare <code>@TransactionalEventListener</code> on a method that doesn't conform to the signature of the <code>ApplicationEventListener</code> interface, you will get a compilation error. This is part of Micronaut's nice ability to compile time check what you are doing with the framework is correct.</p>
<p>In addition to the Adapter advice, the <code>@TransactionalEventListener</code> annotation also declares an <code>@Around</code> advice implementation on line 5 called <code>@TransactionalEventAdvice</code>, which looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Around
@Type(TransactionalEventInterceptor.class)
@Internal
public @interface TransactionalEventAdvice {
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, on line 1, the <code>@TransactionEventAdvice</code> is declared as <code>@Around</code> advice (which remember allows decorating existing behavior), and on line 3, the type of advice is defined as <code>TransactionalEventInterceptor</code>.</p>
<p>The implementation of the <code>TransactionalEventInterceptor</code> is also really simple and intercepts the invocation of the event listener:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public Object intercept(MethodInvocationContext&lt;Object, Object&gt; context) {
    final TransactionalEventListener.TransactionPhase phase = context
            .enumValue(TransactionalEventListener.class, TransactionalEventListener.TransactionPhase.class)
            .orElse(TransactionalEventListener.TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMMIT);
    if (TransactionSynchronizationManager.isSynchronizationActive() &amp;&amp;
            TransactionSynchronizationManager.isActualTransactionActive()) {
        TransactionSynchronizationManager.registerSynchronization(new TransactionSynchronizationAdapter() {

            @Override
            public void beforeCommit(boolean readOnly) {
                if (phase == TransactionalEventListener.TransactionPhase.BEFORE_COMMIT) {
                    context.proceed();
                }
            }

            @Override
            public void afterCompletion(@NonNull Status status) {
                switch (status) {
                    case ROLLED_BACK:
                        if (phase == TransactionalEventListener.TransactionPhase.AFTER_ROLLBACK) {
                            context.proceed();
                        }
                    break;
                    case COMMITTED:
                        if (phase == TransactionalEventListener.TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMMIT) {
                            context.proceed();
                        }
                    break;
                    default:
                        if (phase == TransactionalEventListener.TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMPLETION) {
                            context.proceed();
                        }
                }
            }
        });
    } else {
        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
            LOG.debug(&quot;No active transaction, skipping event {}&quot;, context.getParameterValues()[0]);
        }
    }
    return null;
}
</code></pre>
<p>On line 2, the transaction phase the event applies to is looked up from the annotation metadata. Then on line 5, the interceptors checks if there is an active transaction. If there is no active transaction, the event listener is skipped on line 38. Otherwise on line 7, a new transaction synchronization is registered. Depending on the phase, the listener is only invoked via the proceed method when the appropriate transaction event occurs. For example, on transaction commit, the method will be invoked on line 26.</p>
<p>And with that we have working transactional events!</p>
<p>The following shows an example in action:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Singleton
public class BookManager {
    private final BookRepository bookRepository;
    private final ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher;

    public BookManager(BookRepository bookRepository, ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher) {
        this.bookRepository = bookRepository;
        this.eventPublisher = eventPublisher;
    }

    @Transactional
    void saveBook(String title, int pages) {
        final Book book = new Book(title, pages);
        bookRepository.save(book);
        eventPublisher.publishEvent(new NewBookEvent(book));
    }

    @TransactionalEventListener
    void onNewBook(NewBookEvent event) {
        System.out.println(&quot;book = &quot; + event.book);
    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>First, on line 6, the constructor of the class gets a reference to the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/index.html">ApplicationEventPublisher</a>. The method on line 11 is declared as transactional, saving an object and then publishing the event.</p>
<p>The method on line 17 is declared with <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/blob/master/data-tx/src/main/java/io/micronaut/transaction/annotation/TransactionalEventListener.java">@TransactionalEventListener</a> and for the moment just prints out the event. If the transaction fails for whatever reason, however, the event will never be received and the output never printed.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>There is a definite lack of information on how compelling the Micronaut AOP implementation is, and I hope this blog post goes some way to resolving that. Micronaut AOP has some really nice features and makes it really simple to define AOP advice without the need to involve complex runtime bytecode generation solutions that create enormous stack traces and place additional memory strain on your application.</p>
<p>My recent experience using Micronaut AOP to build Micronaut Data further highlighted to me the advances we have made in this area, pushing developers to avoid the use of reflection, which optimizes memory consumption and makes it so much easier to go native with GraalVM substrate.</p>]]></description><author>Graeme Rocher</author><guid>2019-10-07-micronaut-aop-awesome-flexibility-without-complexity</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Introduction to Micronaut Multi-tenancy</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2019-08-19-micronaut-multitenancy.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<p>Multi-tenancy, as it relates to software development, is when a single instance of an application is used to service multiple clients (tenants) in such a way that each tenant's data is isolated from the other. Among other things, multi-tenancy enables you to build software as a service (SaaS) applications.</p>
<p>In this complimentary webinar, JVM developers interested in learning how to integrate multi-tenancy in their Micronaut applications get an introduction to Micronaut's multi-tenancy capabilities, including microservice-specific features, such as tenant propogation, and an in-depth demonstration of how to implement this powerful functionality.</p>
<h2>OUTLINE</h2>
<p>The following topics are covered in this webinar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Micronaut built-in tenant resolver</li>
<li>How to build your own tenant resolvers</li>
<li>How to configure tenant propagation</li>
<li>How to test multi-tenancy apps</li>
<li>How to integrate GORM multi-tenancy capabilities with Micronautâs multi-tenancy offering</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team">Micronaut team</a> at <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/">Object Computing, Inc.</a> (OCI) unveiled <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data">Micronaut Data</a> (previously known as Predator), a brand new Open Source project that aims to dramatically improve the runtime and memory performance of data access repository logic for the microservice and serverless era, while also maintaining the productivity benefits of tools like <a href="https://gorm.grails.org">GORM</a> and <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-data">Spring Data</a>.</p>
<h2>History of Data Access Toolkits</h2>
<p>The data repository pattern can be traced back to 2004, when Ruby on Rails debuted with a feature called ActiveRecordÂ â an API that revolutionized data access from a productivity perspective.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Grails team brought an ActiveRecord-like API to the JVM for the first time with the creation of GORM (part of Grails). GORM relied on the dynamic nature of the Groovy language to implement finder methods on top of Hibernate and provided the same productivity benefits for JVM users.</p>
<p>Due to GORM's reliance on the Groovy language, Spring Data was created in 2011 to address the need for Java users, allowing finder methods like <code>findByTitle</code> to be defined in an interface and the query logic to be implemented automatically at runtime.</p>
<h2>How Data Access Toolkits Work</h2>
<p>All of these implementations use the same general pattern, which is to construct a meta-model of the entities in a project <em>at runtime</em>Â that models the relationships between your entity classes. In Spring Data, this is the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/mapping/context/MappingContext.html">MappingContext</a>, and in GORM, this is also called the <a href="http://gorm.grails.org/latest/api/org/grails/datastore/mapping/model/MappingContext.html">MappingContext</a>. They are constructed by scanning entity classes and analyzing the classes via reflection. (The naming similarity here is no coincidence. In 2010, I worked with the Spring Data team to try and fork GORM into something for Java, a project which eventually evolved into what is Spring Data today.)</p>
<p>This meta-model is then used to translate a finder expression like <code>bookRepository.findByTitle(&quot;The Stand&quot;)</code> into an abstract Query model at runtime using a combination of regular expression pattern matching and custom logic. The abstract Query model is needed, since the target query dialect differs for each database (SQL, JPA-QL, Cypher, Bson etc.).</p>
<h2>Data Repository Support and Micronaut</h2>
<p>Since we launched Micronaut just over a year ago, the number one feature users have asked us for is &quot;GORM for Java&quot; or Spring Data Support. So many developers love the productivity experience that these toolkits provide, as well as the ease of simply defining an interface that the framework implements. I would go so far as to say a big part of Grails' and Spring Boot's success can be attributed to GORM and Spring Data respectively.</p>
<p>For Groovy users of Micronaut, we have had GORM support from day one, which left Java and Kotlin users needing to roll their own repository implementations.</p>
<p>It would have been technically possible, and frankly easier, to simply add a Micronaut module that configured Spring Data. However, by going down that path, we would have introduced a feature that is implemented in a manner using all the techniques Micronaut has tried to avoid: extensive use of runtime proxies, reflection, and high memory consumption.</p>
<h2>Introducing Micronaut Data</h2>
<p>Micronaut Data uses Micronaut's ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation APIs to move the entity meta-model into your compiler and translate a finder expression like <code>findByTitle</code> into the appropriate SQL or JPA-QL queryÂ <em>at compilation time</em>. A very thin runtime layer that uses Micronaut's reflection-free compilation-time AOP then only has to execute the query and return the results.</p>
<p>The result is staggering ... significantly reduced cold starts, astonishingly lean memory consumption, and dramatically improved performance.</p>
<p>Today, we are open sourcing Micronaut Data under the Apache license, and it comes with two initial implementations (with more planned for the future) for JPA (using Hibernate) and for SQL with JDBC.</p>
<p>The JDBC implementation is the one I am most excited about, as it completely eliminates reflection, runtime proxies, and dynamic classloading for your persistence layer and results in massive performance gains. The runtime layer is so light that even an equivalent repository method written by hand would not execute faster.</p>
<h2>Micronaut Data Performance</h2>
<p>Since Micronaut Data does not have to do any query translation at runtime, the performance gain is significant. In a world of utility cloud computing, where billing models are changing such that you pay for the amount of time your application is running or the execution time of an individual function, developers often overlook the performance of their data access toolkits.</p>
<p>The following tableÂ summarizes the performance difference you can expect for a finder expression, such as <code>findByTitle</code>, when compared to other implementations. All benchmarks were carried outÂ using test hardware of an 8-core Xeon iMac Pro under the same conditions, are Open Source, and can beÂ <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data">found in the repository</a>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Implementation</th><th>Operations per Second</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Micronaut DataÂ JDBC</td><td>225K ops/sec</td></tr>
<tr><td>Micronaut Data JPA</td><td>130K ops/sec</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spring Data JPA</td><td>90K ops/sec</td></tr>
<tr><td>GORM JPA</td><td>50K ops/sec</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spring Data JDBC</td><td>Finders Not Supported</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Yes, you read that right. With Micronaut Data JDBC, you can expect nearly 4X the performance of GORM and 2.5X the performance of Spring Data.</p>
<p>If you go with Micronaut Data JPA, even then, you can expect more than 2X the performance of GORM and up to 40% better performance than Spring Data JPA.</p>
<hr />
<h6>UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2, 2019</h6>
<p>Since this post was written both Micronaut Data and Spring Data have been further optimized and the latest result data on the same test hardware is as follows (Note the Spring Data JDBC numbers use a hard coded query):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Implementation</th><th>Operations per Second</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Micronaut Data JDBC</td><td>430K ops/sec</td></tr>
<tr><td>Micronaut Data JPA</td><td>145K ops/sec</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spring Data JPA</td><td>140K ops/sec</td></tr>
<tr><td>GORM JPA</td><td>50K ops/sec</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spring Data JDBC</td><td>275K ops/sec</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h6>END UPDATE</h6>
<hr />
<p>Micronaut Data is able to achieve such a significant performance jump for a variety of reasons, from the elimination of reflection to the much thinner runtime component. One reason, however, is pretty simple to identify: Stack Traces.</p>
<p>Take a look at the difference in Stack Trace size when using Micronaut Data compared to the alternatives:</p>

<p><img src="2019-07-18-img04.png" alt="GORM" /></p>
<p>Micronaut Data JDBC produces only 15 stack frames until your query is actually executed, while Micronaut Data JPA produces 30 (mainly Hibernate frames), compared to 50+ stack frames for Spring Data or GORM, all thanks to Micronaut's reflection-free AOP layer.</p>
<p>Shorter stack traces also result in easier-to-debug applications. One of the benefits of doing most of the work at compile time is that errors can be detected at compile time, greatly improving the developer experience by providing immediate compilation errors instead of runtime errors for many common mistakes.</p>
<h2>Micronaut Data Compile-Time Checking</h2>
<p>Most repository implementations rely exclusively on doing all the computation at runtime. This means that if the user makes any mistakes when defining the repository interface, they are not caught until the application is actually running.</p>
<p>This removes some of the type checking benefits of Java and provides a poor developer experience. With Micronaut Data, that is not the case. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@JdbcRepository(dialect = Dialect.H2)
public interface BookRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Book, Long&gt; {
    ==Book findByTile(String t);==
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here the <code>BookRepository</code> is attempting a query on an entity called <code>Book</code> that has a property called <code>title</code>. Unfortunately, the finder has a typo, in that it is <code>findByTile</code> instead of <code>findByTitle</code>. Instead of waiting until runtime to inform the user of this fact, Micronaut Data will fail at compilation time with an informative error message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Error:(9, 10) java: Unable to implement Repository method:
BookRepository.findByTile(String title). Cannot use [Equals] criterion on non-existent property path: tile
</code></pre>
<p>Many aspects of Micronaut Data are compilation-time checked whenever possible to ensure that if an error does occur at runtime, it is not due to a typo in a repository definition.</p>
<h2>Micronaut Data JDBC and GraalVM Substrate</h2>
<p>Another reason to be excited about Micronaut Data JDBC is that it is compatible out-of-the-box with GraalVM Substrate native images without needing complex, byte-code-mutating build-time enhancement solutions, like those required to get Hibernate operational on GraalVM.</p>
<p>By completely eliminating all reflection and dynamic proxies from the persistence layer, Micronaut Data hugely simplifies getting applications that access data running on GraalVM.</p>
<p>The Micronaut Data JDBC example application included in the repository runs without problem in Substrate and produces a significantly smaller native image (25MB smaller!) than what is required to pull in Hibernate, thanks to the much thinner runtime layer.</p>
<p>We saw the same result when we implemented compilation time computation of bean validation rules for Micronaut 1.2. The native image size dropped by 10MB by removing the dependency on Hibernate Validator and the JAR file size by 2MB.</p>
<p>The advantage here is clear: By doing more work during compilation and creating leaner runtimes, you produce smaller native images and JAR files, which results in smaller and easier-to-deploy microservices when deployed via Docker images.Â The future of frameworks for Java is more powerful compilers and smaller, lighter runtimes!</p>
<h2>Micronaut Data and the Future</h2>
<p>We are just getting started with Micronaut Data, and we are crazy-excited about the possibilities it opens up.</p>
<p>Initially, we are launching with support for JPA and SQL, but you can expect support for MongoDB, Neo4j, Reactive SQL, and other databases in the future. Thankfully, doing this work is a lot simpler because much of Micronaut Data is actually based on a fork of the GORM source code, and we will be able to reuse logic from GORM for Neo4j and GORM for MongoDB to get those implementations ready sooner than you may expect.</p>
<p>Micronaut Data is the culmination of putting together various building blocks in Micronaut Core that made it possible, from the AoT APIs, which are also used to <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-openapi">generate Swagger documentation</a>, to the relatively new <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#introspection">Bean Introspection support</a>, which allows introspection of beans at runtime without using reflection.</p>
<p>Micronaut provides the building blocks to do some amazing things. Micronaut Data is one those things, and we are just getting started on delivering on some of the promising foundations delivered in Micronaut 1.0.</p>]]></description><author>Graeme Rocher</author><guid>2019-07-18-unleashing-predator-precomputed-data-repositories</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Developing Alexa Skills with Micronaut</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2019-06-06-developing-alexa-skills-with-micronaut.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/springboot.html"><span class="hashtag">#springboot</span></a></p>
<p>Along with the release of <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/releases/tag/v1.0.1">Micronaut 1.0.1</a>, the <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team">Micronaut team</a> at <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/">Object Computing, Inc.</a> (OCI) is excited to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-spring">Micronaut for Spring 1.0 M1</a>.</p>
<p>Micronaut for Spring adds the ability to use the long-established Spring annotation-based programming model to build Micronaut applications and libraries that work with both Micronaut and Spring.</p>
<p>The provided <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-spring/tree/master/examples/greeting-service">example application</a> is at the source level a Spring Boot application. Using ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, Micronaut is able to compute and interpret the Spring annotation programming model and produce a valid Micronaut application without adding any runtime overhead. The Micronaut application is then executable on GraalVM:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/JvzD2SEw0-E" title="Micronaut for Spring"><img src="2018-11-13-img01.gif" alt="Micronaut for Spring" /></a></p>
<p>The way this works is fairly simple.</p>
<p>Micronaut has a set of annotations that are used at runtime to implement the framework. Spring has another set that map pretty simply onto Micronaut's annotations. You could consider these annotations as a source-code level Domain Specific Language (DSL).</p>
<p>At compilation time, the annotation metadata is interpreted and the Spring annotation mapped to the equivalent Micronaut annotation metadata, and just like that, Micronaut can run a Spring application.</p>
<p>Note that only a subset of Spring is supported, but it's enough to build real applications and libraries that work whether they're included in a Spring Boot application or a Micronaut application.</p>
<h2>What's In It for Micronaut Developers?</h2>
<p>Although including Spring in the application dependencies has some downsides for Micronaut developers (notably a JAR size increase from 13MB to 29MB), using the Spring annotation programming model also has some interesting upsides, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tooling Support.</strong> If you import the application into a Spring-aware IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA or STS 4.0, the Spring features &quot;just work.&quot; This makes sense because IDEs operate on the source code, so as far as IDEs are concerned, the application is a Spring application, even if at runtime the application is in fact a Micronaut application. The same would be the case for any source-code level tooling in the Spring ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Spring and Grails Compatibility.</strong> By using the Spring annotation programming model, it is possible to build auto-configurations, endpoints, controllers, and libraries that work with Spring Boot, Grails, and Micronaut.Â </li>
<li><strong>Easier Migration to Micronaut.</strong> While not every feature of Spring is supported, the vast majority of the important aspects are. This makes it easier to train new developers, migrate existing code, and embrace Micronaut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if your source code only references Spring annotations and not Spring interfaces, Spring can actually be a &quot;compile-only&quot; dependency, which would shrink the JAR size back to 13MB and bring all of the benefits mentioned above.</p>
<h2>What's In It for Spring Developers?</h2>
<p>For Spring developers, the benefits are numerous too.</p>
<p>Micronaut has the ability to take the Spring programming model places it was never able to go before, due to performance or memory consumption constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT).</strong>Â Micronaut runs great in IoT scenarios, including on the baby Raspberry Pi. This is because the memory profile of a Micronaut application has nothing to do with a Spring or Jakarta EE application, with significant savings to be had.</li>
<li><strong>GraalVM.</strong>Â Micronaut is the first framework to bring the true Spring programming model to GraalVM in any kind of realistic way. You can run what is essentially a Spring Boot application at the source code level on GraalVM today and implement lightning-fast functions and low-memory footprint microservices.</li>
<li><strong>Android.</strong>Â I remember during the early days of my time at SpringSource, the ambition to get the Spring programming model onto Android. It never actually happened; only small Spring components like RestTemplate ever make it to Android. The Micronaut core container is <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#android">already running on Android</a> and has the potential to bring the entire Spring programming model to Android. We have significant ambition for Micronaut on Android.</li>
<li><strong>AOT Compilation.</strong> Micronaut can be thought of as a framework for AOT, with a complete API for performing many AOT tasks across language implementations. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-spring/tree/master/examples/greeting-service">referenced example</a> application is able to compute the Swagger API metadata at compile time thanks to Micronaut, even though no Micronaut API is actually referenced.</li>
<li><strong>Serverless.</strong> With Micronaut's faster cold startup and lower memory costs, it just got a whole lot easier to build efficient applications that use the Spring programming model.</li>
<li><strong>Library Compatibility.</strong>Â Projects like JHipster and Spring Boot Admin can now include Micronaut for Spring as a compilation-time annotation processor and be made to work with both Spring Boot and Micronaut. This is huge news for the library ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Micronaut Features in Spring.</strong>Â Since annotation mapping works in any class, you get a <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-spring/blob/master/examples/greeting-service/src/test/java/greeting/example/GreetingClient.java">Spring annotation-based compile-time declarative HTTP client</a> and can use any other Micronaut feature out of the box.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, with Micronaut for Spring, it is also now technically possible to write Spring Boot auto configurations that work across Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Grails. The Spring team at Pivotal could even take this library and make much of <strong>spring-boot-autoconfigure</strong> work with either Spring Boot or Micronaut.</p>
<p>The way this would work is that Spring Boot computes the auto-configuration at runtime, while if the compilation-time metadata is there, Micronaut loads it automatically without requiring additional runtime computation.</p>
<p>Since Micronaut can also be used as a parent application context for Spring Boot, the core of Spring Boot could even be updated to use Micronaut for internal wiring and bring GraalVM compatibility to Spring Boot. If the Pivotal developers are interested <a href="https://gitter.im/micronautfw">we are happy to chat</a>.</p>
<h2>What's In It for Grails Developers?</h2>
<p>The primary reason we developed Micronaut for Spring is, in fact, for Grails 4.0.</p>
<p>I have begun working on Grails 4.0, and as part of the planning, we want to enable Grails developers to benefit from the investment we have made in Micronaut over the past year.</p>
<p>In Grails 4.0, Micronaut will take over as the parent context for Grails applications, and much of the internal wiring of Grails will be based on Micronaut instead of Spring, so that we can reduce memory consumption and improve startup time. This, combined with the improvements the Spring team has already made in Spring Boot 2.1, will result in significant improvements to Grails 4.x applications in terms of memory consumption and startup time.</p>
<p>Since Micronaut will be the parent context for Grails 4.0 applications, it also means that every feature we develop for Micronaut will be usable in a Grails 4.0 application, from the compile-time clients â like the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#clientAnnotation">HTTP client</a> and <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#kafkaClient">Kafka client</a> â to features like service discovery and client-side load balancing.</p>
<h2>What About MicroProfile?</h2>
<p>I had the pleasure to chat with some folks involved in <a href="https://microprofile.io" title="MicroProfile">MicroProfile</a>, and while the ambition of the project is interesting, any model that is based on the runtime analysis of annotations via reflection is unfortunately going to suffer from memory consumption issues, hence my doubts regarding current implementations.Â </p>
<p>Having said that and having read the specification, Micronaut's ability to support any annotation set at compilation time using AOT means that Micronaut could technically support MicroProfile using the same approach as Micronaut for Spring.</p>
<p>In other words, there is no reason a JAX-RS / CDI-based implementation of MicroProfile could not be implemented by mapping the annotations and providing a few interface bridges. If the MicroProfile folks are interested in chatting with us about that, <a href="https://gitter.im/micronautfw">we are around and available to chat</a>.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>When I first introduced Micronaut at Greach earlier this year, I mentioned that Micronaut is far more than just another HTTP server implementation (a new HTTP server written in Java seems to pop up on Github every week!). Micronaut has the potential to revolutionize how applications are built for the JVM by completely changing the runtime characteristics of a typical Spring and/or Jakarta EE application, while retaining largely the same feature set that developers know and love.</p>
<p>By making AOT accessible to JVM users and bringing compatibility to AOT across languages (Java, Kotlin, and Groovy currently), Micronaut is able to decouple the source code from the runtime environment like no other framework has done before. That, ladies and gentlemen, is <a href="/blog/2018-09-30-micronaut-1-rc1.html">The Power of Ahead of Time Compilation</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to hear more, I will deliver a <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/resources/events/webinars/introduction-to-micronaut" title="Complimentary Webinar">complimentary webinar</a> on Micronaut on Wednesday, November 14, 2018, and I will be speaking about Micronaut at <a href="https://dvbe18.confinabox.com/talk/BZV-3566/Introduction_to_Micronaut:_Lightweight_Microservices_with_Ahead_of_Time_Compilation">Devoxx Belgium</a> on Thursday, November 15, 2018.

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>In this 45-minute talk presented at Voxxed Days Microservices Paris in October 2018, Micronaut co-founder, Graeme Rocher, introduces the framework and demonstrates how you can take your microservices to the next level with Micronaut's ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and Oracle's GraalVM to achieve instant startup and low memory footprint.</p>
<p>Micronaut is a brand new, open source, JVM-based framework for building full-stack, modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications.</p>
<p>Unlike reflection-based IoC frameworks which load and cache reflection data for every single field, method, and constructor in your code, with Micronaut, your application startup time and memory consumption are not bound to the size of your codebase.</p>
<p>Micronaut's cloud support is built right in, including support for common discovery services, distributed tracing tools, and cloud runtimes.</p>
<p>In this talk, Graeme introduces the framework and demonstrates how you can take your microservices to the next level with Micronaut's ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and Oracle's GraalVM to achieve instant startup with an astonishingly lean memory footprint.</p>

<p>With one week to go to <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/resources/events/conferences/oracle-code-one-2018">Oracle Code One 2018</a>, the <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team">Micronaut team</a> at <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/">Object Computing, Inc.</a> (OCI) is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0.RC3">Micronaut 1.0 RC3</a>.</p>
<p>This is the final RC before we release GA on the 23rd of October.</p>
<p>With this release, we are pleased to also announce the first RC of <a href="https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html">Micronaut Test</a>: a simple collection of extensions for JUnit 5 and Spock that adds a few niceties that make it simpler to test Micronaut applications.</p>
<p>Micronaut Test adds the following testing-specific features to Micronaut:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automatically start and stop the server for the scope of a test suite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use mocks to replace existing beans for the scope of a test suite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow dependency injection into a test instance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is an example test written in Spock:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">package io.micronaut.test.spock

import io.micronaut.test.annotation.MicronautTest
import spock.lang.*
import javax.inject.Inject

@MicronautTest
class MathServiceSpec extends Specification {

    @Inject
    MathService mathService

    @Unroll
    void &quot;should compute #num times 4&quot;() {
        when:
        def result = mathService.compute(num)

        then:
        result == expected

        where:
        num | expected
        2   | 8
        3   | 12
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see from the example above, simply by adding the <code>@MicronautTest</code> annotation to any Spock or JUnit 5 test, the test automatically becomes a candidate for dependency injection.</p>
<p>Micronaut Test includes many more features, including integration with Spock's mocking framework and Mockito for JUnit 5.</p>

<p>Following <a href="/blog/2018-09-30-micronaut-1-rc1.html">last week's Micronaut 1.0.0 RC1 release</a>, we are pleased to <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0.RC2">announce the availability of Micronaut 1.0.0 RC2</a>, which includes improvements following feedback from the community (thanks to all those who reported issues!).</p>
<p>This second RC presents a further opportunity to test Micronaut and provide feedback as we build up to the GA release, which is scheduled for the 23rd of October â just in time for <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/index.php?cID=1336" title="Oracle Code One 2018">Oracle Code One 2018</a> in San Francisco where I will be <a href="https://oracle.rainfocus.com/widget/oracle/oow18/catalogcodeone18?search=Micronaut">presenting on Micronaut</a>!</p>
<p>In addition, if you're in Europe, and San Francisco is little far, consider attending <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/index.php?cID=1343" title="Voxxed Days Microservices Paris">Voxxed Days Paris</a>, where I will be <a href="https://voxxeddays.com/microservices/2018/10/05/graeme-rocher-on-micronaut/">presenting Micronaut on the 30th of October</a>.</p>
<p>In my previous post, I elaborated on some of the design choices we made with Micronaut with regards to avoiding the use of reflection as much as possible and how that benefits both the developer and the performance of the application.</p>
<p>In this post, I will elaborate a bit more on the challenges facing traditional Java frameworks and how Micronaut solves those challenges.</p>
<h2>Java Giveth and Taketh Away</h2>
<p>Java and the JVM provide a rich platform on which to build frameworks that enhance developer productivity. Features such as annotations, reflection, the ability to create runtime proxies, and so on are the staple of how most Java frameworks work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some challenges and limitations framework developers have to deal with that result in compromising either memory consumption or startup time including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type Erasure.</strong>Â The Java generics system was added later in Java's lifecycle; since backward compatibility was a requirement, the result is type erasure. The amount of runtime logic in existing Java frameworks and tools to deal with type erasure is mind blowing.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Annotation Metadata.</strong> Java has annotations, but a number of patterns have emerged in Java frameworks for using annotation stereotypes (or meta-annotations) that are, by default, not supported by the Java API. Computing annotation metadata is therefore left to each framework to implement.</li>
<li><strong>No Parameter Names.</strong> By default, Java and the JVM do not retain parameter name information. It is possible to work around this by adding -parameters flag to the Java compiler, but it is disabled by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are these issues a challenge for Java frameworks like Spring and Jakarta EE? Let's take a simple example where you define an interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">interface HelloOperations&lt;T&gt; {
    @Get(&quot;/hello/{name}&quot;)
    T hello(@NotBlank T name);

    @Get(&quot;/hello-many/{names}&quot;)
    T helloMany(@NotEmpty List&lt;T&gt; names);
}

@Controller(&quot;/&quot;)
class HelloController implements HelloOperations&lt;String&gt; {

    @Override
    String hello(String name)  {
        // logic here
    }

    @Override
    String helloMany(List&lt;String&gt; names)  {
        // logic here
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Lines 2 and 3 on the <code>HelloOperations</code> interface define a route using annotations, and in addition, define a <code>@NotBlank</code> constraint on the name parameter. (Note that I have used Micronaut annotations, but the same example could be written in Jakarta EE or Spring).</p>
<p>The <code>HelloController</code> implements the interface and provides the logic. Now, you would think this seemingly simple example would be easy for framework developers to handle, but the tasks involved include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing the annotation metadata and stereotypes for each method and on the class of the controller</li>
<li>Traversing the class and interface hierarchy of the <code>HelloController</code> class to figure out the inherited annotations on the name parameter</li>
<li>Dealing with generics and type erasure requirements that the parameter introduces on the class for both the return type and the argument</li>
<li>Generating a runtime proxy to validate the <code>@NotBlank</code> constraint, which reflectively calls <code>HelloController</code></li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is just for a trivial example. As you add more methods, deeper inheritance hierarchies, more interfaces, and so on, the requirements become more and more complex, and all of these requirements have to be handled at <strong>runtime</strong>.Â </p>
<p>In order to support all of these features that Java developers love without adversely impacting runtime performance, traditional Java frameworks cache heavily, which leads to increasing memory consumption, since the two problems are not reconcilable â you have to choose between slow runtime performance or poor memory consumption.</p>
<h2>The Micronaut Way</h2>
<p>So how is this situation handled in Micronaut?</p>
<p>Instead of performing all of this analysis on your classes at runtime, Micronaut computes everything at compilation time using ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.</p>
<h3>Generic Type Information</h3>
<p>All generic type information for beans and method arguments is computed ahead of time. For example, to retrieve the type parameter for List in the <code>helloMany</code> method inside an AOP interceptor, you can simply do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public Object intercept(MethodInvocationContext context) {
       Map&lt;String, MutableArgumentValue&lt;?&gt;&gt; parameters = context.getParameters();
       MutableArgumentValue&lt;?&gt; namesArgument = parameters.get(&quot;names&quot;);
       Argument&lt;?&gt; typeArgument = namesArgument.getFirstTypeVariable().orElse(Argument.OBJECT_ARGUMENT);
      ....
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the parameter name data is present and has not be erased. Processing at the source code level allows Micronaut to retain parameter name data.</p>
<p>In addition,Â Micronaut will also compute type arguments for types and store them in the BeanDefinition, so if you need to compute the type parameters for a type, you don't need to jump through reflective hoops either:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">BeanDefinition&lt;HelloController&gt; helloDefinition =
                  beanContext.getBeanDefinition(HelloController.class);

List&lt;Argument&lt;?&gt;&gt; typeArguments =
                  helloDefinition.getTypeArguments(HelloOperations.class);

// do something with the type arguments
</code></pre>
<p>The above example retrieves the <code>BeanDefinition</code> for the <code>HelloController</code> bean and then retrieves the type arguments used for the <code>HelloOperations</code> interface, all without requiring expensive reflective processing.</p>
<h3>Annotation Metadata</h3>
<p>The regular Java API makes you jump through hoops to retrieve the annotation metadata on the previous example. You have to traverse through the class and interface hierarchy, reflectively loading each method and potentially dealing with visibility issues to retrieve all of the <code>java.lang.reflect.Method</code> instances that are included the hierarchy.</p>
<p>You then have to process each method to merge together all the potential annotations by looking at the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Method.html#getParameterAnnotations--"><code>getParameterAnnotations()</code></a> method that returns a multi-dimension array with each parameter indexed by the order they appear in the method.Â </p>
<p>All this complexity is not needed with Micronaut, because the annotation metadata has already been computed at compile time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Map&lt;String, MutableArgumentValue&lt;?&gt;&gt; parameters = context.getParameters();
MutableArgumentValue&lt;?&gt; namesArgument = parameters.get(&quot;names&quot;);
if (namesArgument.getAnnotationMetadata().hasStereotype(NotEmpty.class)) {
     if (CollectionUtils.isEmpty((Collection) namesArgument.getValue())) {
          throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Named parameter cannot be blank&quot;);
     }
 }

</code></pre>
<h3>Reflection-Free Proxies</h3>
<p>Finally, Micronaut will also at compile time produce a proxy that is a regular class and not one created via Java's native proxy mechanism, eliminating the need for reflection at the proxy level.</p>
<p>This has a number of benefits including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less work to do at runtime, improving startup and reducing memory consumption</li>
<li>Shorter, easier to understand stack traces â since the proxy invokes your code directly, huge framework level stack traces are less of an issue</li>
<li>Easier for the JIT to optimize â the Java JIT has an easier time of optimizing direct calls than reflective calls</li>
<li>No need to cache reflection data â reading reflection data is expensive, so most frameworks cache method references, increasing further memory requirements</li>
<li>Easier compatibility with GraalVM â although proxies are possible on GraalVM native image, these have to be <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/DYNAMIC_PROXY.md">configured ahead of time</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This may sound complex, but the simplicity it enables for developers is a huge win. For example, if you wish to implement your AOP advice, such as introduction advice, there are only a few steps required.</p>
<p>As an example, say you want to implement logic from an interface at compilation time. Testing frameworks, for example, often have tools for creating stubs or mocks that return alternative values from interfaces. Let's see how you could implement stubbing in Mironaut. Step 1 is to create an annotation, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Introduction
@Type(StubIntroduction.class)
@Bean
@Documented
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE, ElementType.METHOD})
public @interface Stub {
    String value() default &quot;&quot;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>On line 1 the advice is defined as introduction advice and given a type of <code>StubIntroduction</code> on line 2. The <code>StubInroduction</code> type should implement <code>MethodInterceptor</code> interface. The following is a trivial implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Singleton
public class StubIntroduction implements MethodInterceptor&lt;Object,Object&gt; {

    @Override
    public Object intercept(MethodInvocationContext&lt;Object, Object&gt; context) {
        return context.getValue(
                Stub.class,
                context.getReturnType().getType()
        ).orElse(null);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>On line 6, the implementation tries to convert the value given to the <code>@Stub</code> annotation and return it as the result of the method call, otherwise null is returned. Now you can simply use the <code>@Stub</code> annotation on any interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">@Stub
public interface StubExample {

    @Stub(&quot;10&quot;)
    int getNumber();

    @Stub(&quot;Fred&quot;)
    String getName();
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>getNumber()</code> method will return 10 and the <code>getName()</code> method will return &quot;Fred&quot;. It is that simple. There is no need to rely on a container to add this functionality, or build a <code>ProxyFactoryBean</code> implementation to configure anything at runtime, it just works and it works without using any reflection whatsoever.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In addition to being great for microservices, Micronaut is a general-purpose application framework that has huge potential to revolutionize the efficiency of modern Java applications.</p>
<p>Through AOT compilation, Micronaut is able to pre-compute your application's requirements and do a lot of the heavy lifting before it's up and running. This is a complete departure from how previous generations of Java application frameworks work, and it allows Micronaut to go places traditional Java frameworks don't normally tread.</p>

<p>Tags: <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/release.html"><span class="hashtag">#release</span></a> <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/openapi.html"><span class="hashtag">#openapi</span></a> <a href="https://micronaut.io/blog/tag/graalvm.html"><span class="hashtag">#graalvm</span></a></p>
<p>Today, it is with great pleasure that the team at <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/">Object Computing, Inc.</a> (OCI) announces the release of Micronaut 1.0 RC1.</p>
<p>Over a year in the making, Micronaut represents a significant step forward in microservice frameworks for the JVM, by supporting all of the features Java developers know and love, such as dependency injection (DI) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP), without making compromises on startup time, performance, and memory consumption.</p>
<p>Micronaut 1.0 is now feature complete (see theÂ <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/1.0.x/guide/index.html#whatsNew">user guide</a> for a summary of what's new in the RC) and, more than any other prior milestone release, this RC demonstrates clearly the advantage Micronaut has when it comes to ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation over traditional Java frameworks.Â </p>
<h2>Reflection and Making Java Frameworks More Efficient</h2>
<p>The Java reflection API has been around a long time and is used extensively by libraries and frameworks throughout the Java ecosystem.</p>
<p>The majority of modern frameworks use a reflection-based approach to invoke endpoints, create proxies, perform data binding, read configuration, and so on. It is quite remarkable how much dynamic, reflection-based logic exists in a typical modern Java application, given that the language itself is statically typed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, using the reflection API comes with some significant costs, both in terms of memory and runtime performance, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because there is no common reflection cache in Java, and reading reflective data is expensive, each library and framework produces a unique reflection cache. In a typical modern Java application, you will find Spring has a unique cache, Groovy has another cache, Jackson another, and so on. This makes it extremely difficult to optimize memory consumption.</li>
<li>Reflective calls are much more difficult for the JIT to optimize. Efforts such as InvokeDynamic and others try to alleviate this situation, but reflective calls will never be as efficient.</li>
<li>Most frameworks are not aware of the diverse language eco-ystem on the JVM. Languages such as Groovy and Kotlin produce more methods at the byte code level than Java does to support the additional language features they provide. This difference means that reflection caches are often larger for Groovy- and Kotlin-based classes, since the byte code contains more methods, fields, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the key goals we set out to achieve when developing Micronaut was to enhance Java's efficiency and make it viable and possible to run applications that contain no compromises in terms of modern framework features but occupy 10s of megabytes of memory instead of 100s of megabytes.</p>
<p>Although Micronaut has many features that are undeniably beneficial to the creation of microservices, Micronaut is, in fact, a general purpose framework that can be used to build a range of applications, from CLI applications, to functions that run in the cloud, to scheduled jobs that process data from Kafka.</p>
<p>Micronaut features a custom-builtÂ <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/1.0.x/guide/index.html#ioc">DI</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/1.0.x/guide/index.html#aop">AOP model</a>Â thatÂ <em>does not</em>Â use reflection.</p>
<p>Instead, an abstraction over the Java annotation processor API (APT) and Groovy AST enable developers to build efficient applications without giving up features they know and love.</p>
<p>This approach has opened doors to myriad framework features that are more easily achieved with AOT compilation and that are unique to Micronaut.</p>
<h2>Feature 1: GraalVM Native Image Support</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>Â is a new universal virtual machine from Oracle that includes a polyglot runtime and a unique feature that allows compiling Java applications into a native image.</p>
<p>Due to Micronaut's compile-time, reflection-free approach to DI and AOP, you can natively compile a Micronaut application into a GraalVM native image, allowing the application to start up in milliseconds while consuming only a fraction of the memory of a regular Java application running on the JVM.</p>
<p>Check out this little animation demonstrating the feature in action:</p>
<p><img src="2018-09-30-img01.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>With a GraalVM native image, Micronaut's startup time drops from around 1 second to around 20ms, while memory consumption drops from around 60mb (most of which is occupied by the JVM) to around 20mb for the native process.</p>
<p>Although GraalVM does have ways to activate support for traditional reflection, these are unwieldy and sub-optimal. Micronaut provides out-of-the-box support for building GraalVM-compatible applications without the developer having to have deep knowledge of which classes require reflection and which do not.</p>
<p>See the section onÂ <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/1.0.x/guide/index.html#graal">GraalVM and Micronaut</a>Â in the user guide for more information on this feature.Â </p>
<h2>Feature 2: Compilation-Time Support for Swagger (OpenAPI)</h2>
<p>Micronaut 1.0 includesÂ <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/guide/index.html#openapi">compile-time support for Swagger</a>, the industry standard tool for describing APIs. The majority of frameworks that integrateÂ <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>Â do so at runtime, using extensive reflection-based approaches that are problematic from both a performance and a memory-consumption perspective.</p>
<p>Micronaut features aÂ <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/1.0.x/api/io/micronaut/inject/visitor/package-summary.html">comprehensive, language-neutral visitor API</a>Â that allows developers to perform compile-time analysis without depending directly on Groovy's AST or Java's APT. The Swagger support in Micronaut builds on this feature.</p>
<p>For example, consider this simple &quot;hello world&quot; example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Controller(&quot;/&quot;)
@Validated
public class HelloController {
    @Get(uri=&quot;/hello/{name}&quot;, produces=&quot;text/plain&quot;)
    public Single&lt;String&gt; hello(@NotBlank String name) {
        return Single.just(&quot;Hello &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once configured, Micronaut will at compile time build the appropriate Swagger YAML which can easily be added as a static resource that can then be imported into theÂ <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>Â (a React / Node application) without needing any additional runtime reflection in your Java code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">paths:
  /hello/{name}:
    get:
      operationId: hello
      parameters:
      - name: name
        in: path
        required: true
        explode: false
        schema:
          type: string
      responses:
        default:
          content:
            text/plain:
              schema:
                type: string
</code></pre>
<h2>Feature 3: Compile-Time Validation</h2>
<p>All modern Java frameworks include a bunch of inherit rules that you as a developer cannot violate, and while languages like Java provide you with compile-time checking mechanisms to confirm that your code is correct, most modern frameworks do not, relying instead on runtime exceptions to inform the user that his or her code is wrong.</p>
<p>In fact a <a href="https://blog.softwaremill.com/the-case-against-annotations-4b2fb170ed67">common criticism</a> leveled at annotation-based programming models among static-compilation fans is the dynamic references you have to place in the annotations that are not statically checked.Â </p>
<p>Although these issues have not prevented annotation-based programming models from becoming the most popular among Java developers, they can lead to a frustrating experience. This was something we wanted to address in the design of Micronaut.</p>
<p>Let's take an example, consider the following simple route definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Get(&quot;/hello/{name}&quot;)
public Single&lt;String&gt; hello(@NotBlank String na) {
     return Single.just(&quot;Hello &quot; + na + &quot;!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Spot the obvious typo?</p>
<p>The route defines a variable calledÂ <code>name</code>, but the method accepts a parameter calledÂ <code>na</code>. With the majority of modern frameworks, this will lead to a runtime error.</p>
<p>But not with Micronaut:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javastacktrace">hello-world-java/src/main/java/example/HelloController.java:34: error: The route declares a uri variable named [name], but no corresponding method argument is present
    public Single&lt;String&gt; hello(@NotBlank String na) {
                          ^
</code></pre>
<p>This feature is powered by Micronaut's extensive support for compile-time visitors that validate you are using the framework correctly and provide early feedback to obvious framework-related problems in your code.</p>
<p>In addition, this checking mechanism works whether you are a Java, Kotlin, or Groovy developer. Micronaut's abstraction across language ASTs ensures a consistent experience regardless of which language you choose.</p>
<h2>Feature 4: Mapping Annotations at Compile Time</h2>
<p>The approach we took in the design of Micronaut necessitated the creation of a new set of Java annotations enhanced to trigger AOT compilation.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional Java frameworks, such as Java EE (now Jakarta EE) and Spring, that perform analysis of framework-level annotations at runtime, Micronaut performs this same analysis but at compilation time, allowing startup performance to be faster (particularly as your application grows) and memory consumption to be significantly lower.</p>
<p>There are, however, a number of excellent specifications and standards in the Java space that developers are already comfortable with; it made sense to support these in Micronaut. Thanks to Micronaut's extensive annotation metadata, you can map the values of any annotation to the values of any other annotations at compile time using an AnnotationMapper.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is Micronaut can support annotations such as <code>javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed</code> for security or <code>javax.persistence.PersistenceContext</code> for injecting a JPA <code>EntityManager</code>.</p>
<p>The API for this is trivial; the following example is taken from <code>RolesAllowedAnnotationMapper</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public List&lt;AnnotationValue&lt;?&gt;&gt; map(AnnotationValue&lt;RolesAllowed&gt; annotation) {
    String[] values = annotation.get(&quot;value&quot;, String[].class).orElse(new String[0]);

    List&lt;AnnotationValue&lt;?&gt;&gt; annotationValues = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(1);
    annotationValues.add(
            AnnotationValue.builder(Secured.class)
                            .values(values)
                            .build()
    );
    return annotationValues;
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, line 1 receives the annotation being mapped and is able to return one or many new annotations that map to an internal framework feature (in this case, security).</p>
<p>We anticipate supporting more standard Java annotations in the future using this feature.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We are extremely excited about Micronaut 1.0 and believe it is at the forefront of the growing movement towards AOT compilation in the Java space.</p>
<p>AOT compilation is the next big innovation coming to Java frameworks because it allows Java applications to be optimally built for scenarios such as low-memory footprint microservices, IoT (yes Micronaut runs on the Raspberry Pi), serverless, and so on.</p>
<p>Whether you are building a client or a server, a scheduled job or a stream processing application, Micronaut has a compelling set of features that you can introduce without paying the heavy cost associated with most current Java frameworks.</p>
<p>The release of 1.0 RC1 is just the start, and we have a lot more coming on the roadmap, including better integration with Grails. The response we have had from the enthusiastic Micronaut user community has been outstanding, and we look forward to hearing feedback as we approach the final GA release in the next few weeks.</p>]]></description><author>Graeme Rocher</author><guid>2018-09-30-micronaut-1-rc1</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Meet Galecinocar: A Micronaut-powered, 1:16 scale self-driving car</title><link>https://micronaut.io/blog/2018-08-14-galecino-car.html</link><description><![CDATA[</p>

<p>Today, it is with great pleasure that we <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core">open source Micronaut on Github</a>.</p>
<p>Micronaut represents a significant advancement in how a range of application types â with a particular focus on microservices â are built for the JVM.</p>
<p>Micronaut comes to you from <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/">Object Computing, Inc.</a> (OCI) and the team that built the <a href="http://grails.org/">Grails framework</a>. <strong>It builds upon over 10 years of experience creating application frameworks for the JVM.</strong></p>
<p>By leveraging the lessons learned building the Grails framework, we have built a toolkit that encompasses all the modern features developers have come to expect from a framework, including dependency injection, AOP, configuration management, and more.</p>
<p>With Micronaut, however, we've <strong>eliminated the runtime overhead</strong> â in terms of memory consumption and startup time â found in traditional frameworks. This is achieved through the use of annotation processors that pre-compile all the necessary metadata and information needed to run your application ahead of time, eliminating the need for reflection and cached reflective metadata at the framework level.</p>
<p>Micronaut also features both an <strong>HTTP client</strong> and an <strong>HTTP server built on Netty</strong>, plus a range of tools to aid deployment into a cloud environment.</p>
<p>Micronaut supports building applications in <strong>Groovy, Java, and Kotlin</strong>. Its design takes heavy inspiration from Spring and Grails to ensure that it is as simple as possible for developers to become fully proficient with the framework.</p>
<p>For more about these features, view the comprehensiveÂ <a href="http://micronaut.io/documentation.html">Snapshot documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Next week atÂ <a href="https://gr8conf.eu/">Gr8Conf Europe</a>Â in Denmark, our team will deliver numerous talks and workshops on Micronaut for those interested in getting a head start using the Framework.</p>
<p>We will also be releasing theÂ first milestone of Micronaut 1.0 next week, which will be followed quickly with regular milestone releases and ultimately aÂ GA release later this year.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, we will be working diligently to build out the Frameworkâs features and capabilities, so please stay tuned and feel free toÂ <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues">submit your ideas and suggestions to us</a>.</p>
<p>With warm regards,Â Graeme Rocher</p>]]></description><author>Graeme Rocher</author><guid>2018-05-23-micronaut-open-sourced</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
