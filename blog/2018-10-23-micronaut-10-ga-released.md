It is with great excitement that the [Micronaut team](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team) at [Object Computing, Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/) (OCI) announces the [release of Micronaut 1.0 GA](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0) today.

Over a year in the making, Micronaut 1.0 represents a major leap forward in our mission to enable developers to create efficient, low-memory-footprint microservices and serverless apps for the JVM.

Micronaut includes [all the tools a modern developer needs](https://docs.micronaut.io) to effectively build microservices for the JVM without compromising memory footprint and startup time, including:

*   Integrated compile-time dependency injection and AOP
*   Cloud-native configuration management
*   Service discovery and client-side load balancing
*   Integrated HTTP client and server-based Netty
*   Sensible defaults and auto configuration
