Micronaut Data is a database access toolkit that uses ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces that are then executed by a thin, lightweight runtime layer. Since Micronaut Data does not do any query translation at runtime, the performance gain is significant. 

Spend an hour with Micronaut co-founder, Graeme Rocher, to learn more about this revolutionary new development tool. Learn what it's capable of and find out how to get started.

This is a great learning opportunity for Java developers interested in maximizing their productivity, whether they use the Micronaut framework or not. No experience with Micronaut is required; however you will benefit if you're already familiar with the JVM, web development, and data-access strategies in general.
